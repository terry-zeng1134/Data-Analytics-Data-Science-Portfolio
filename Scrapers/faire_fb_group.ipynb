And if you're selling online, you use that UPC code for all the variants so the products can be seen on Google.  With this new release, when you scan the UPC code of any of the variants., only the first variant comes up and it is added directly to the cart - and if you're not paying attention, you'll come to realize that you're ringing up the wrong product - over and over again.
