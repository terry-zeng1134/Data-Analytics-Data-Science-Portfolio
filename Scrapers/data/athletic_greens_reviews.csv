athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Dawn S.,4/29/22," I listened to the social media content creators and influencers. They mentioned the “sweet like bubblegum “ taste, the great energy, and their long term loyalty to AG1. Previously, I took a high-quality daily vitamin and immune booster. I’m 10 weeks in with AG1. I drink it first thing every morning. The taste is easily tolerable. The energy is gentle and long. My digestion is regular. I can’t put my finger on exactly why; I just feel better. Try it for 4 weeks and see if it works for you. It’s not for everyone but I haven’t read any negative reviews. The only areas for improvement in my mind are the cost and length of shipping. ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Scott M.,4/28/22," Only wish they could do something about the foaming after is is shaken up in the bottle, a lot of waste. Other than that have been very happy with the effects on my body!!!! ",5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Nyanontee C.,4/29/22, I had stopped using Athletic Greens for a couple of months and started with a popular vitamin brand. I noticed I was always feeling sluggish and had to start using caffeine again (more and more each couple of days). I started using AG again and haven’t had to use caffeine since. My energy is through the roof and my cognitive function has improved. My body seemed to thank me before I even took my first sip! ,5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Daniel W.,4/28/22, Have heard so many glowing reviews I had to purchase. I used the product for 90 days and didn’t experience one gain or improvement that was advertised. Can’t say it’s bad but can’t say it’s good. Definitely took a page from Apples marketing guide.

I take it every morning on an empty stomach and it has allowed me to create such a healthy morning routine, and it tastes good! When I take it consistently I've noticed fewer IBS symptoms and a more regulated digestive system. ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Paul R.,4/28/22," I've been adding Athletic Greens to my daily routine for about 3 months and feel pretty darn good. As a runner who also lifts weights and lives a pretty active lifestyle, nutrition is very important. While I'd like to get all my nutrients from actual food, that's just not practical on a day to day basis, but it feels like this supplement is the next best option. I'll just drink it with about 10oz of water each morning and it tastes delicious. It also doesn't seem to affect my stomach if I immediately run after and my energy is good. All in all I'm happy with how I feel. ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Kenny W.,4/28/22," I LOVE the AG product, but I hate the bag that it come in. Why not offer it in a canister? And, it is too costly, as compared to other brands. ",4

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Paula L.,4/28/22," Great product. I’ve been using this every day for almost 2 months. It’s a lot easier for me to drink the AG1 vs take 10 vitamins in the morning and then another 10 before bed. In my opinion AG is a decent price, if I calculated all the vitamins I would take on a monthly basis, the amount would be the same or more and AG1 has a ton more vitamins and minerals than what I was consuming.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Seth P.,4/28/22, It is a good product with decent taste. Takes a little bit to get use to. I did feel better after drinking it. The cost is expensive plus you get charged 9$ for shipping. You are almost paying 100$ a month. There are lots of other options out there that are more affordable. ,3
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Robert S.,4/28/22," I have been using AG because I have been suffering from digestive issues. AG is supplementing nutrients that I have not been consuming because of my illness. It has helped me maintain whatever health level I am able to maintain.

I'm trying it myself to use it up and haven't notice any difference in how I feel. The powder doesn't dissolve well and sinks to the bottom of the glass. It has a sweet and gritty taste. It would probably taste better mixed in a smoothie but I don't drink smoothies. It's also very expensive for what it is. ",2

I am unsure if drinking dehydrated vegetables and the like is for me, the flavour is brutal. However, with your greens, while brutally flavoured equal to any competitor product, is the only product that I completed the entire package. Here is why... when I drink your greens in the morning my brain seems satiated for a very long time, which for someone who grazes all day is quite intriguing. I also find I have less call for an afternoon nap. Little else has changed in my lifestyle so these changes I attribute to having your product in water each morning. I am thankful that you have done little to add nasty berry flavours and what not, but wish that there was some way to make it taste less like cattle feed (we are cattle farmers so yes I know what their feed tastes like).

That was my MAIN focus in trying this, but after about a week of drinking it, I started to think maybe the coffee I was drinking in the mornings was now superfluous, and it WAS. It’s kinda crazy to give up something that has been such a long standing part of my life, but AG gives me the focus and alertness I need to start my day. I really like knowing the first thing I do every day is something healthy. The ONLY day it was hard to drink was the day I was super hungover, but even water was rough that day, and I felt noticeably better after I choked it down 😂 I’m about 45 days in, and I love it.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Kevin D.,4/27/22," so health food never tastes good... supposed that's why most supplements are tablets. I am unsure if drinking dehydrated vegetables and the like is for me, the flavour is brutal. However, with your greens, while brutally flavoured equal to any competitor product, is the only product that I completed the entire package. Here is why... when I drink your greens in the morning my brain seems satiated for a very long time, which for someone who grazes all day is quite intriguing. I also find I have less call for an afternoon nap. Little else has changed in my lifestyle so these changes I attribute to having your product in water each morning. I am thankful that you have done little to add nasty berry flavours and what not, but wish that there was some way to make it taste less like cattle feed (we are cattle farmers so yes I know what their feed tastes like). Im sure i will be buying more. ",4

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Aja P.,4/27/22," I really love drinking AG in the morning, I’ve been a Shakeology nut for like 5 years now, but I always worry about getting enough greens in especially on days I travel (because I’m not bringing a blender and searching out spinach for a shake on vacation). That was my MAIN focus in trying this, but after about a week of drinking it, I started to think maybe the coffee I was drinking in the mornings was now superfluous, and it WAS. It’s kinda crazy to give up something that has been such a long standing part of my life, but AG gives me the focus and alertness I need to start my day. I really like knowing the first thing I do every day is something healthy. The ONLY day it was hard to drink was the day I was super hungover, but even water was rough that day, and I felt noticeably better after I choked it down 😂 I’m about 45 days in, and I love it. I’ve shared it with a friend too, and he ALSO loved it and noticed he didn’t want it need coffee in the mornings. Kind of a PIA to keep it in the fridge if you’re on the go a lot, and you only get the big pack, but the packets are great, also great packet design for easy pouring. I ordered some immediately after trying to bring a couple doses away for a weekend and keep them cold. Just get the packets lol. ",5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Gregory D.,4/21/22," Slightly sweet, bubble gum taste. I've never been able to stick to vitamin habits because they upset my stomach. I never have that vitamin nauseous feeling with AG. It's great. I stir in a bit of psyllium husk powder and it makes it nuttier, less sweet. Big fan. ",4
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Mark H.,4/21/22, 3.5 stars. Good product. It tastes nice. It has good bones for a nutritionally sound and well formulated product. But its over priced compared to what else is available these days for comprehensive nutrition products. If they drop the price $15 and ship it for free I’d probably continue using it. Otherwise I’ve got lots of other options. ,3
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Carson D.,4/21/22," Great product. Taste is something that is a bid hit or miss for the people I know that tried it, however for me taste was fine.

It doesn’t taste great, but it also doesn’t taste bad. I have noticed since i started taking AG1 that my skin has been clearer and my fingernails, which normally are brittle and break easily, have grown long and are much stronger. Seems like if there are visible results that there are likely several other benefits that I can’t visibly see, so I am sold. Great product! ",5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Anna B.,4/20/22," I’m in the second month of taking Athletic Greens. From day one - whether it was my own mental reset or something in the blend - my coffee intake (I drink 90% decaf, but religiously) became less manic, as well as my urge to settle my stomach by adding the next snack. Stomach feels more at ease and I eat when I’m hungry.  (and I’m not positive why yet), the cyclical/weather headaches I have been getting for years have subsided. I dared to hope this would help and I think it has.  ",4

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Sepia K.,4/20/22," Hi there! Well I love the greens product, I've been feeling great since taking it, and I notice I crave it every morning when I wake up. However, the shaker bottle is a terrible design and has a real impact on my enjoyment in using the product. I've already contacted customer service and they sent me a new bottle, same problem. There's a small plastic ring that has to be perfectly aligned each day in the the groove, and even when it seems like it's in there properly, I frequently shake the bottle only to have green water squirt out the sides of the lid. I do this carefully now each time, but it's still really annoying, leaking out the bottle and down the side. I really hope you'll come up with a simple bottle and lid that doesn't have a removable part! Thanks so much for the great greens! ",4
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Lisa L.,4/20/22, This is the easiest green powder to take because the scent isn’t bitter (slightly sweet) and leaves a clean taste when using just water. It helps me with energy during the day. It’s better than coffee and really easy to drink. ,5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Kimalee P.,4/20/22," Since beginning to drink my AGs daily, I have actually noticed a difference in my digestive system, my energy levels and just feeling stronger and clearer in mind. The convenience of it also makes it easy to use, increasing my chances of never skipping a day. I made sure to purchase the travel pack because I don't want to miss out on this goodness when I have to be away from home. One of my best investments for 2022, that's for sure. ",5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Caroline F.,4/20/22, I waited to review Athletic Greens until consistently drinking it for an entire month and I can honestly say they have helped tremendously! My husband and I both drink Athletic Greens in the morning on an empty stomach on our way to work and it gives you that burst of energy in the morning and helps regulate out gut! We live on an island in the Caribbean and dark greens and probiotics are hard to come by so we swear by this stuff! The taste was a little earthly but we got used to it and will even add it to our morning smoothies for a special treat! ,5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Frank H.,4/20/22, A week after drinking AG1 every morning I've noticed my craving for sweets has all but disappeared. I cannot say this is because of AG1 but I'll take it. Seem to drink less coffee in the morning too. Again I can't link this to AG1 but the timing is interesting. Overall more energy during the day too. ,5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Aliya F.,4/20/22," Honestly I don’t know what I was expecting, but this wasn’t it. It tastes very faintly of pineapple but not enough to cover the rest of that classic, gross veggie supplement taste. It wouldn’t mix in water properly at all, so I kept trying to find new juices to mix or blend it into, which kind of defeats the purpose. The nutrition is sound, so I felt good having it, but that’s about it. ",3
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Artur B.,4/20/22," I felt a significant uptick in regularity, more comfortable digestion, and steadier energy levels within a week of taking ag1 regularly.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Thompson B.,4/19/22," It doesn’t taste bad, but it’s certainly not an enjoyable chug in the morning.

Sometimes I'll consume about a third or half (4-6oz) and fall back asleep, waking up feeling amazing & can only assume AG1 plays a role in this. To be honest the price can be a little high in my opinion & I have considered substitute morning greens products to save on cost. For the cost & convenience, AG1 is worth every penny. ",5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Michelle M.,4/11/22," I’ve been taking AG for a week now. I’ve tried several other supplements, greens, etc over the years and nothing has made a difference until this…. From the moment I took my first few sips I could literally instantly feel my energy level going up. My workouts have improved and as well as endurance. I do intermittent fasting and directions are to take on an empty stomach. The first few days I was mildly nauseous but after that I was fine. Taste is bland so I decided to add my LMNT (electrolyte powder) in with it and that was a great improvement. I drink it with filtered room temperature water with a couple ice cubes to get it down quickly. I no longer need to buy multi vitamins, super B’s, D3. I do however continue to take fish oil, glucosamine and probiotics (needed more mg’s). So although the price may seem high, it will pay off as you no longer need to buy certain supplements anymore. I honestly feel even more healthier than I ever have before and my focus is even better. I was on the fence about spending so much money for so long but so glad I took the plunge! Also it’s money back guarantee if it doesn’t work for you so it’s a win-win. Highly recommend! ",5

And during the days or weeks when I do the best I can with how I’m “supposed” to drink AG1 - I still feel great! It started with just me drinking it, but now my husband is hooked, too. And here’s the thing: I never said out loud how much energy I felt it gave me. I just said “it makes me feel great”. But after he drank it for maybe a week? 10 days? He said TO ME “I have so much energy!” So I know it works! And maybe the whole just feeling good internally, translates to looking good (glowing skin) externally. I am getting compliments from people I see all the time! They’d say “you look so good! You’re skin is glowing”. It’s magical stuff and we are hooked! ",5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Brian S.,4/6/22," Love your product, but it is three times as expensive as your competitors. While I prefer AG1 the price may convince me to switch. Perhaps cutting out the fancy packaging or expedited shipping may help curb costs ",3
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Christie H.,4/6/22, The taste is good but I have been using them on a empty stomach for two months and don’t feel any different yet. I thought I would feel something by now. ,2
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Kenneth D.,4/6/22," I have already sent in an initial review and my assessment still remains the same.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,David D.,4/6/22, Convenient and high quality ,5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Diane L.,4/6/22, I’ve tried a few products similar to AG1 in the past so was hesitant - not a big fan of overtly sweet and gritty drinks. I was pleasantly surprised that AG1 did not have that same synthetic sweetness (!) and had a s-m-o-o-t-h mouthfeel. That alone would cement AG1 at the top of my list but the reason why it’ll stay there? Its quality ingredients that make me feel better. ,5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Ana L.,4/6/22," Absolutely life changing. My partner and I are both musicians in NYC leading a somewhat hectic lifestyle in terms of scheduling, consistent meals, and sleep. AG1 has been in our morning routine for 2 months now and while we felt that we noticed an increased level of energy after just a couple of days, it was definitely confirmed over the next several weeks that we have boosted our baseline of function by using AG1 every day. We can trust that on the days where we are unable to access the fully nutritional meals we aim to consume, that our basic needs have been well met and maintained by our consistent consumption of Athletic Greens ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Mark J.,4/6/22, Athletic Greens seems like the most premium solution in the greens supplement market - but it also has the price tag to match. ,4

Without changing a thing about my diet and exercise program other than taking my greens every morning for two months now, my hair is thicker, my eyelashes are longer, my skin is smooth and even toned, my energy is consistent through out the day and thats just to name a few of the things I've noticed so far. What's even more fabulous is others are noticing these not so subtle changes too. I recommend AG1 to everyone! ",5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Bradley C.,4/6/22," It's really good and I feel better on days I drink a shake with it inside. It's too expensive though. I started these to see how it would be taking these nutrients in drink form instead of pill form. I'm debating whether to go back to pills since I don't have a problem as long as I take them throughout the day. It's enough of a difference to notice, specially in these hard times ",4

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Joseph V.,4/5/22, Great stuff. ,5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,taylor g.,4/5/22," I had heard of AG for some time, but was hesitant to try the product for two reasons. One the price is high compared to similar products, and two although all of the ingredients are listed there is not an amount aka weight of each listed. I would be willing to pay close to $100 per month if I felt the product was really spectacular and out competed other products. This brings me to my experience using AG. First impression looks, smells, and taste like a multivitamin. Feeling after drinking a glass, no change in mood, cognition, energy. After two months of drinking AG every day I haven’t noticed any difference in health compared to before use.  ",3
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Renee H.,4/5/22, This is probably the easiest and best tasting way to get all your greens down. We'll be making it a part of our routine long term. ,5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Brian S.,4/5/22," This is way overpriced for what it is. I have a Ph.D. in biology and have been trained at the best programs in the world, so this is where I am coming from. That is the search image. The short of everything is that I already purchase and create custom smoothies that are far better (i.e., more bio- and chemically diverse) than the complement in Athletic Greens. If I traveled a lot, if I didn't know any better, if I wanted a cheap and easy overpriced fix to offset what I don't know about physiology, then sure, I might buy this stuff. Yet why outsource the benefit of my education? Why pay more for what I already do a better job with? There is no point. Athletic Greens is an ineffective use of my time, energy, and money. Simple and done. ",1

I did not like it at first...it's unexpectedly spicy. Makes me feel better that I have something green first thing in the morning though! ",3

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Jodi W.,4/2/22," So i do like this and i have noticed a difference since using it. It has loads of great ingredients and nutrients compared to the competition and the taste is tolerable. My only thing is- it is more expensive than the competitor’s so some people may not consider it “necessary”. And the taste is fine, but i personally mix it with juice when i know i shouldn’t. So perhaps making a few flavored options in the future or capsule form would be a great suggestion in the future. ",3

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Carver U.,4/2/22," The problem with most vitamins is that eventually I get burned out on trying to take the pills and remember which ones I took which days. I’ve tried tricks like having the weeklong pill containers for the ones I didn’t take every day but after about 3-4 weeks I always start to be more “relaxed” in my consumption. This isn’t the case with AG1, not only because it’s convenient but also because I have come to find it tasty. If you have ever taken old vitamins and had unpleasant burps, then you know that not all vitamins are tasty, and I think that by being able to taste what’s going in you get a much better grasp on the freshness of the ingredients. What I’ve read is that most things in there oxidized form have little to no efficacy so this is really important for vitamins. Oh! And I’ve felt more consistently WELL while taking AG1 and after I crunched the numbers I’m spending about the same amount as my inconsistent pill habit was costing me. No real downsides I can think of, and I’m not one to hold back. Try it if you’re serious about your health and your time is a premium for you! ",5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Matthew B.,4/2/22," Prior I was taking vitamins every day and decided after many years and significant research to try something else. I tried a couple others with no real change. Same goes for AG1. I'll give it another month or so its been over two month so far and no real difference except an expensive month restocking fee. I think the price point could be less. Every podcast I listen to is advertising AG1, I'm sure the price point is so high because the marketing budget must be through the roof. If the product is that good it speaks for itself and word of mouth will take it to the next level. ",2

While I do use other supplements, I have been able to cut my multivitamin dose in half and hope to eliminate it altogether to save money as AG1 is rather expensive especially considering that they charge a shipping fee with each delivery. If I have any complaints it would be the shipping fee. The product is expensive enough that I feel they should either reduce or eliminate the shipping fee. ",5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Jason A.,3/29/22," I was someone who took a daily multi, turmeric, b vitamins as well and was feeling better since adding the later to the daily multi. Then I had heard good things about AG Greens, not having any stomach issues and training for a marathon currently I figured let's get on board with this and see if Rich Roll, and Dax Shepard are right? Been on it for 2 months now and energy levels, and digestion are essentially the same, my wallet on the other hand is not. Needless to say at $80 a bag for a month my justification is the assurance my body is getting what it needs not knowing exactly what is in it or how it is manufactured or produced. If its not making me feel worse, and supposed to give me all I need which I was honestly lacking in terms of greens in general then the cost should be an investment on my health. I have received my last two bag to complete while I have a little over a month of marathon training left, at 45 years old I want what best for my body to perform at the highest level it can, so I am stuck between bottles, and green can at this time. We'll see. ",4

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Elizabeth A.,3/25/22," AG1 is my go-to every morning (I prefer to drink it mixed with orange juice). I was skeptical at first - that was 7 months ago. After one month I had more energy, after two my fingernails started growing again, after three months I took a break because I was traveling and about a week without any AG1 my nails started to become soft and tear (now I take travel packs with me when I'm on the road). It may feel pricey but my AG1 subscription has become a top priority in my budget because of how much benefit I get from the nutrients it provides. ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Luke S.,3/25/22," I think the nutrients and everything is great -- I love the idea of this. Seems to be beneficial. But over time I'm definitely getting to the point where I really don't enjoy the taste at all, I have to power through this. Maybe mixing it with some things will help, I'll start doing smoothies or something. I think it's a quality product, but if y'all could change up the flavoring, it would help the drinkability ",4
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Maddy,3/25/22," I love AG1. I am notorious for finding new fads on social media, buying in at a promotional price, and then canceling my subscription...but AG1 is too good to cancel. I have been taking AG1 for a few months now and I didn't know if it was really worth it until I skipped a few days and realized my body needs it. It helps to heal my gut and keep me ""regular"". When I skip it, I feel bloated and constipated. I am traveling for a week and had to place an extra order for the travel packs because I didn't want to skip it for that long! It is a very expensive habit to keep up, but it is the best thing I do for my body. ",5

I was struggling with trying to balance and know what all vitamins I needed in a day and this has been the best and most simple way to get everything in one easy delicious drink. The flavor is super refreshing especially with a spritz of lemon. I've noticed increased levels in my energy and even small things like my nails and hair growing and becoming stronger. I am so grateful to have found this product and recommend it to everyone I know. The only reason I gave it one less than 5 stars is because in my first box I did not receive the 5 travel packs, and sometimes the shipping gets delayed and I go a week or 2 without my daily AG1. But I hate to be negative when it comes to this product because it has done wonders for my health overall so thank you 😊 ",4

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Natalie E.,3/16/22," My morning routine used to consist of how quickly I got to the coffee pot, now I start every morning with 8oz of AG1 followed by a healthy breakfast. I drink much less coffee but I have more energy and because I am taking AG1 I have a built in motivation not to skip my workout.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Michael W.,3/16/22," My gosh is it expensive! Everything, BUT the cost, is great. I’m in my 3rd month of the subscription and I think I’m ready to quit this test. The next best competitor is nearly 50% cheaper and I can put up with the bad taste. Don’t get me wrong. The service is great! And the advertising will hook you. In the end, the vast majority of consumers will look elsewhere, especially, in this economy. Thanks for everything AG, but you’re like buying a brand new Mercedes-Benz on a middle class budget. I’ll stick with my Honda… saves me cost of a tank of gas per month. And THAT makes me happy. ",3

Big improvement in one month! 2) I have a little more energy in the morning, and it builds the habit of drinking 10oz of water right when you wake up.

I’ve tried to like the taste but on its own it’s terrible! Only mixed into a shake it tastes good but I don’t have time to make a shake every morning and the vitamix is just too loud in the early morning to make the shake and would wake up my little boy. If you can somehow develop a good taste with this shake on its own mixed in with just water in its little shaker, then it will become a regular part of my everyday supplements. Otherwise, I think I’ll probably have to discontinue buying this. I think maybe it’s just not physically possible to have all these ingredients taste good?…that is the big challenge to conquer while keeping the integrity of the ingredients…good luck!! ❤️ ",2

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Julie W.,3/7/22," I've been looking for a liquid supplement that tastes good and is easy to store and prepare. AG1 more than delivers on all counts. It's easy to digest and I love the travel packets. In 30 days of use, I can tell a difference in my energy levels. No weird side effects that can sometimes come with loading up on vitamins or greens. I didn't realize they were such an established brand until I heard Tim Ferriss talking about them from 10 years ago. ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Isabel C.,3/7/22," I was a little worried since it's green, when you think green you think grass but I was surprised it tasted pretty good. I didn't see anything different my energy was the same, I didn't choose healthier chooses and I didn't notice any difference in my sleep pattern.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Judi t.,3/7/22, I found it hard to even use AG1 daily because I was put off by the taste.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Rachel B.,3/7/22, I loved all the vitamins packed into AG1. However found myself dreading it every morning because just couldn’t get past the taste. I like that it isn’t loaded with sweeteners/artificial flavors to give it a better taste- so I’m not sure what my solution would be. I gag my way through it to get the benefits but won’t be buying again next month. ,3

I recognize that two months is not a long time and when I began this process planned on giving this product 6 months. Nothing in this world happens after night but I believe I’m on the right track taking my greens every morning. ",4
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Juli Z.,3/7/22," While I don’t feel any particular improvement in anything, I like the fact that AG1 provides needed vitamins, I don’t need to take a separate multivitamin pill. I haven’t noticed any particular improvement in energy, but I do like it that if my die let isn’t perfect on a particular day, AG1 has me covered. The packaging is great, and it mixes easily. On the downside, the drink is pretty tasteless, and somewhat gritty. I can’t say that getting it down is the happiest part of my day. However, it’s not horrible either, and I think it’s a positive addition to my diet. Summary: good nutrition, tastes meh. ",4

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Dave F.,3/7/22," My husband and I have been taking AG1 for about 1 1/2 months so far. It is great not to have to swallow lots of supplements; however, it is too much liquid for me to drink. As a woman, I also feel maybe the amount of greens should be less than a full scoop, or based on a person’s weight. My husband is almost twice my size, yet, we both use a full scoop. At any rate, it has not given us any energy, or have we felt any better. My nails are growing which is the only positive I have noticed. AG1 is expensive; we feel there should be more noticeable benefits. We’ll try for one more month to see if we benefit from using AG1. ",4

I’ve done the research on AG and am confident the ingredients are of the highest quality and are designed to work together for optimum benefit.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Nicholas W.,3/4/22," Great product! The taste isn’t bad at all and it mixes easily. Packaging and containers are great. I’ve been taking for about 2 months now and the reason to take a star away would be… I don’t know that I FEEL anything different. Was hoping for more energy, maybe less brain fog, maybe I am overthinking it but I just don’t really feel any different. Still taking as I know it’s good for me. ",4
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Vicky C.,3/4/22, Great customer service ,5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Ellen Y.,3/4/22," This is quite a tasty morning drink. I tried it because a podcaster I listen to recommended it, saying it’s a way to get all the vitamins he needs. A second podcast I tried also says that. I’m not denying it’s all they need, but I noticed it didn’t cover the vitamin and mineral bases I personally want, a biggie for me being calcium, and then also vitamin D although AG gave a bottle of vitamin D oil, it’s not a convenient way to take it. I noticed if I add it to a drink, later when washing the inside of the glass it felt oily, meaning I’m not actually not getting all the vitamin inside me, or who knows to what extent. At any rate, because for me it’s quite expensive, I paused my subscription to take pill versions of what I believe I need in terms of vitamin and mineral. ",3

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Lindsay G.,3/4/22," I started taking this right before the holidays. It took me a little while, like a week or two to get used to the “flavor”. It’s definitely “earthy” like some say, but even as I say that I don’t know what that really means haha. I try not to smell it while drinking it, for some reason that helps me. I used the bottle that came with my purchase but it started leaking almost immediately so now I just use a blender bottle, mix it with cold water and drink it down first thing in the morning. I will say it’s not the greatest about fully mixing or dissolving, even after shaking for the recommended time. It definitely settles and my last few sips are pretty grainy which is unpleasant and hard to get down. The packaging and branding is very nice. I like the refillable container. Easy subscription and shipping refills. Overall I like it and feel like I’m getting good vitamins and minerals in my system. ",4

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Joshua C.,3/1/22," Most of my review is anecdotal. I can't point to any clear data as in laboratory blood tests or bio markers to show I'm healthier for having taken your product for one month. That being said, I tend to notice I feel ""better""; more alert, awake and lively after drinking AG1. If I'm noticing an increase in well being, immediately after taking it, I have to imagine that the product is having a positive influence upon my body in a concrete way. I currently only take the supplement once every other day due to cost. I'm not griping about cost because if it's as good a product as it's claimed to be, with professionals like Dr. David Sinclair going on about it, then I can spend approximately three dollars a drink I suppose. When you look at it from a cost to benefit ratio, its not too much an expenditure. Some people spend a buck fifty on a Mountain Dew daily. I can spend twice that for a supplement that ensures a more well rounded diet. This was a rather long review to get to the nuts and bolts of; I think it's working. Thanks. ",4

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Tara P.,2/28/22," I have been using athletic greens for about 4 months now. I didnt expect a powder is a miracle. I also know the benefits of healthy eating and diet come over time. I just don't know that I can recommend this because while it is convenient, tasty and somewhat comparable in price to other high quality multivitamins, I have not felt any measurable difference or benefit. Not in my energy, not in regularity. This is just an honest review. Obviously I had hoped for a better outcome, I definitely do not wish to be critical, but it's just honest. It's just my personal experience. It's an expense. Investing in your health is worth it, I just can't say for certain this product is. I just don't know one way or the other. ",2

Take that into consideration along with the texture, that can’t be helped... it was just not worth the daily gagging to finish the glass... even if I mixed it with pineapple juice. Husband drinks it every morning without fail... still waiting for all the positive benefits to kick in. ",4

I like in Canada and my Athletic Greens take only 3 days to get to my door from the US, which is unheard of! My only critique is that it is a little expensive but I figure that it’s worth the price to sustain and maintain good health. I have a stressful 9-5 and I work hard in the gym. Athletic Greens helps me to achieve my goals, gives me focus and gives my body the nutrients it needs to get through my busy days! ",5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Isabelle B.,2/17/22," Skeptical at first. Completely convinced now. You definitely feel the support.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Sadie L.,2/15/22, It’s too soon to complete survey as I’m only on first month of trying it out. I don’t drink it daily.

I tried everything from taking a tablespoon of cod liver oil to drinking apple cider vinegar. While those ingredients do have health benefits I never experienced any marked physical changes from ingesting them. When I heard about Athletic Greens I was skeptical but the reviews were so good I thought I would give it a try. Now I am convinced that drinking it once per day has changed my life for the better!

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Jessica P.,2/11/22," I really love how much thought and care was taken in selecting all the things that went into getting this product delivered - the packaging, the package design, that awesome, perfectly weighted scoop - I loooove the vitamin D oil that came as a bonus with mine! I am used to greens powder that kinda tastes...well really more like dirt or grass grounds, you know like someone freeze dried kale and grass clippings and added some probiotics to it. This powder has an odd, unexpected sweet chalky flavor that I just couldn't handle - it was overpowering. Just too sweet and fake tasting (even though I know this product is very natural and has super high quality ingredients!). This is a taste preference thing for sure, I had to give this a try with all that phenomenal ad targeting, but the flavor just isn't what I'm looking for. ",3

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Nicholas L.,2/11/22, Definitely notice a nice feeling of clean (green) energy from this supplement.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Iman L.,2/11/22," It’s a very good product, but as a Canadian the price point is way too high ",4
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Kevin W.,2/11/22," I'm not athletic. I'm not into fitness. I started AG1 because my eating habits have been garbage for years. I'm working on that. Well it seems my body was definitely starved for many nutrients, because every time I drink my AG1, I can feel my system gush with joy. Frankly, my AG1 at breakfast is helping me kick morning coffee. It definitely puts a little spring in your step that lasts 2-3 hours. Goodbye coffee. ",5

I wish it were cheaper, but so far that hasn't stopped me from buying it. Also I have given thought to the questionnaire that I completed the other day and feel that the biggest improvement I would like would be adding different types of probiotics, maybe even changing them every few months as our guts have a tendency to adjust and adapt. ",4
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Scott C.,2/10/22, I've gotten rid of all my other supplements and now only take Athletic Greens. I take it first thing in the morning as instructed before my workout. It's filling enough to carry me until breakfast. The taste is definitely better than any other similar product I've tried. ,4
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Kathryn M.,2/10/22, Taste is ok. No noticeable effects. ,3
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Wanda W.,2/10/22, I was a bit worried the taste would be like wheat grass or a similarly ‘earthy’ taste but it tastes very subtly of pineapple/tropical flavor. Definitely a great way to get my nutrients and vitamins for the day! ,5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Tina I.,2/10/22," I really like AG- easy to use, full of nutrients, tastes good. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is due to price. It’s one of the more expensive greens on the market and not sustainable for our budget with other brands that are also good. ",4

AG1 is by far the superior greens. With just water they taste amazing, I drink mine with orange juice and the hubby drinks his with cranberry juice.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Catie M.,2/9/22," I have been using Athletic Greens everyday for over 2 months as directed, and not felt any changes one way or the other. I maintain a generally healthy diet, run everyday, do yoga and Pilates once or twice per week, and am the mom of a toddler and work a demanding part time job remotely. I felt good about Athletic Greens as a supplement to help make sure I’m getting nutrients that I may have missed in my diet, but can’t tell physically- no help with energy, fitness or recovery. Because of this and the fact it is quite pricey, I probably will not order again. Additionally, I was very disappointed to see Stevia as an ingredient. ",2

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Carrie M.,2/8/22, Customer service is a 5! pen and scoop out of the bag. The green container has a lid that isn't the most effecient.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Valerie B.,2/8/22," So excited to order AG1 - lived the tin and shaker bottle. Product has an odd flavor and too sweet. Was shocked at the recurring charge of almost $100/month. Thought that that price was high just because I received a tin, vitamin D, travel packs and shaker bottle.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Laurie A.,2/7/22," Initially my order didn't impress me, so I cancelled the autoship. Once I turned the bag over and read the ingredients a little closer, I decided to try again. The original problem was my mixture ratio, and drinking without a straw. I know it sounds weird, but either I was not mixing enough water or it just wasn't mixed thoroughly. I added more water, to make 16oz., a full scoop, shaking to mix and added a straw. ALL THE GOOD THINGS CAME OVER ME. Now, I love it...changed my mind and will be reordering to include convenience packets. I travel quite a bit, whether day trips or week long trips. I see a difference in my daily energy, mood, digestion and overall mental confidence I'm doing something FOR ME, even when I'm pouring out for others. I'm sure there are other benefits...but for now, that's enough.  ",5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Joshua T.,2/7/22, I got this because a number of podcast that I enjoy had them as a sponsor. Sounded great. It wasn't bad and I didn't notice any difference after taking it daily for a couple of months. I'm decently healthy and perhaps others may tell a difference from taking it. Seems like good quality. Shipping and communication are great. Seems a bit pricy. Not bad if it's making a notable positive difference for our health. ,3

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Rohit M.,2/5/22," This is a pretty good mix of potent plant-based ingredients with vitamins and minerals that I'm looking for to start my morning off. The labeling and sourcing are transparent even for the discerning individual. There are a lot of ""green powders"" out on the market, yet we don't know where they get their stuff and how to get about making it. I have tried a lot of them, and AG1 is in my top 3 for sure! The taste is also excellent; I'm on the 52nd version, so I cannot comment on previous versions' tastes. I like that they continue to iterate on something good. Additionally, I don't need to take additional multivitamins or other supplements; it's all in one! I do take their D3 + K2 supplement with AG1. I would highly recommend getting AG! ",5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,James M.,2/4/22, Ya I have found that I enjoy it in the morning. Is it as great as advertised I am not sure about that.

It took a month, but man can I tell the difference now. I get home after a 10 hr work day and still have energy to cook supper and clean. I find myself whistling and just enjoying little things I do. I am very grateful for this product, and especially glad I am exercising again! So thankful for this thoughtful gift from my caring husband. ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Matthew W.,2/4/22," The pouch is what it is: a zipped, re-sealable, thick-ish pouch containing the AG1 powder with an oxygen or moisture absorber and a scoop. It seems to keep the powder fresh until it's opened, at which point you're supposed to refrigerate the contents in their tin or another container. I wish the tear perforations on the pouch allowed it to tear straighter so as not to risk damaging the re-sealing zip in case you want to keep the whole thing in the fridge, but otherwise it's a solid product.

My overall mood is better and my performance level across all activities is at a higher level. I also come from a father who had 50 bottles of vitamins so reducing it down to just one all in one thing is great. My only complaint is wishing the was more Vitamin D in the mix. Other than that, it’s damn near perfect! ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Diana K.,2/3/22," I love AG and drink it every day. My wife has joined me and we both drink it. The taste is great. The only thing I am struggling with os the sandy taste, i.e. even after shaking it for a minute it still has this sandy residue. It helps me when I drink it through the straw. It would be perfect if it would dissolve fully in the water without this “sandy residue”. ",4

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Ryan J.,2/2/22," I felt like I wasn’t getting my body all the nutrients and vitamins it needed on a daily basis. With AG1 I feel like I am now because I trust the science and ingredients behind it. To be honest, I haven’t noticed any changes but this isn’t a “one day cure to feeling like you’re 20 again” kinda thing, I think those are scams. No, this is like a life long companion who cares about your well being and wants to make sure you’re taken care of in the long run. ",4

I am also enjoying the daily health benefits of the greens themselves. The only downside is the price, they are expensive. I understand they are high quality, and if a high price is what it takes to maintain this quality, then I'm willing to pay it and please don't compromise, but the high price is an important part of the decision equation.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,jacob g.,2/1/22," For nearly $90 per month with no noticeable health benefits/effects it just isn't worth it. If it was maybe 1/3 the cost I might stick with it. Also, it doesn't taste great, which is fine when you gulp it down... but the after taste and burps that come later are pretty awful. ",2
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,cabe f.,2/1/22," Well, I've been taking AG1 for 3 months straight and don't feel any difference when I miss a day. I eat a largely whole-foods diet and an omnivore.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Paul S.,2/1/22, I have been using AG1 for six weeks for me it’s the best fastest easiest way for me to get more supplements than I need.

We love the ingredient profile, taste, how we feel, customer service and overall mission of this company. The canisters provided with new subscription make it easy to refrigerate and keep fresh.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Kimberly P.,2/1/22, I had an issue with a subscription delivery.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Sean H.,2/1/22," I really enjoy my AG1, but the price seems on the higher end. I wish the ingredients included more specifics on dosage rather than simply mentioning the blends.

I've shared how much I love this stuff with friends but always make sure they know it's very expensive. I'd like to be able to get three pouches sent to me at a time to cut back on the cost and would love to know why it's so expensive.

My only issue is I have seen a lot of bloggers advertising this stuff and most of them slip in ""and it tastes great"".

While I've been taking Athletic Greens + the vitamin D drops, I haven't been needing to take my daily allergy meds (besides nasal spray).

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Sue F.,1/30/22," I was skeptical about Athletic Greens...they were so heavily promoted by almost every influencer on my social media feeds, it felt like a scam. I received my starter kit with a damaged bag of greens. I reached out to the company who promptly sent me a new bag. The container to hold greens is very nice and useful. The greens are delicious!! Its easy to mix and the bottle given with the starter kit is perfect. My only complaint is the bottle leaks and i end up walking into work with green dribble down the front my scrubs! Overall, I am enjoying Athletic Greens, they really start my day off in a positive way. ",5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Brad F.,1/28/22," The product itself is fantastic. It doesn't taste terrible...don't get me wrong, I wouldn't choose to drink it simply for the flavor but I don't have to choke it down either. The container for the powder that came with mine is stainless steel and so is the spoon which is awesome. The only reason I deducted a star is because of the shaker bottle. Its attractively branded and has nice markings for measuring liquid ozs. However, it is plastic....as much as this product costs I feel like it should come with a stainless steel or glass shaker bottle. ",4

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Daniel S.,1/28/22," I am not here to give a negative review of the product. It’s difficult to review a product for which you may not see objective immediate “results”. With this product you may not see benefits for several months of usage. The probiotics may help with intestinal issues, the greens may help with vitamin supplementation, it may help your immune system. All these claims are dependent on many factors and some can be objectively measured, but who really wants to get lab tests. ",2
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Susan B.,1/28/22, Tried for 30 days to see if I would miss the benefits. I usually made my own green juice. Decided to try this product. I did so for 30 days and decided to reorder product. Love it. ,5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Desiree P.,1/28/22, I am feeling so Good ,5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Steven L.,1/28/22," Well, it was Doctor Huberman who essentially sold AG on me. The thing I like best is that I no longer have to fill my supplement case, a time-consuming task which is so annoying actually I often don't do it so I therefore don't take my supplements. AG is ready for me and it's the first thing I have in the morning so it's great. My only criticism is that Andrew Huberman says it's delicious and I know that's something of personal taste but it took some getting used to to be quite frank. I mix it in with other juices, etc. in the morning and have come up with quite a palatable breakfast concoction. Keep doing your great work!  ",4
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Lissa D.,1/28/22," I’ve been enjoying AG for 6 weeks now. I’ve seen significant improvement in my digestion, energy levels (I’ve cut way back on coffee), and aided me during my quarantine days. It is so pricey - I wish it was just 20-30 dollars less. ",4
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Katherine T.,1/28/22," Great taste, makes it enjoyable to drink. Just a bit out of my price range to continue with the subscription. ",4

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Jennifer M.,1/28/22," Love the AG1 pouch! The flavor has a nice hint of pineapple, and its actually enjoyable to drink. Other greens in the past have a grass like flavor, and to top it off AG has more nutrients than any of my old ones too!! Definitely think its worth it!! ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Bennett W.,1/28/22," Enjoyed the morning shakes! Tastes good! but as a Canadian it’s about 146$ for a 30 day supply, which is a bit steep. ",3

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Lorene K.,1/28/22, Tried a sample first as I normally really hate greens as a drink. To me they are always too chemical pineapple flavoured.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Danyel T.,1/28/22, I hate to admit it but AG1 is hands down THE best greens I’ve ever used. I’ve tried at least five name brand greens supplements before and they fail in comparison. One of the biggest things for me is taste. It’s not gross like the others. Another plus is how easily they dissolve in the water. There’s minimal waste and that’s great news given how expensive the supplement is.  ,5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Andrew T.,1/28/22, Great for on the go use and to use for back up. Leave a few in my truck and in my desk ,5

I also know that I don’t get everything I need through the whole food diet I eat. I use Athletic Green as my daily insurance policy to cover all my additional nutritional needs including pre and probiotics. I also feel that my body benefits from the adaptogens in this supplement helping me be more resilient to the stress I put my body through every day. I recommend AG to my clients and have my family on them too! ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,alexandra J.,1/28/22, So so good and the best customer service ,5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Erik B.,1/28/22," First off, the price was too steep compared to similar products with similar ingredient lists which was a major decision in cancelling my subscription. Secondly, I’m thankful it was only eight ounces I had to drink each day because it’s difficult to choke down. The smell alone is off putting even before you drink it so be ready to chug. I did feel some gastrointestinal effects from it, but not enough after finishing the pouch to continue using it. The ingredients are fresh and all natural and derived from whole foods as stated, and is a good addition to a healthy diet, but I didn’t feel it was a good value considering the lack of noticeable effects for me. ",3
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Adam F.,1/28/22, The product is great. Definitely more energy. Don’t need coffee in the morning. Would totally recommend. ,5

Over the past 20+ years I've invested a lot of time and money into many brands that claim to have the highest quality, best absorption complete multi-vitamin, and all of them have upset my digestive system or caused me to feel light-headed and ""off"" or just haven't felt good....until Athletic Greens!! This is absolutely worth every penny, and I can feel a positive difference in my energy levels, mood and well-being every time I use this product. No upset tummies here, no weird light-headedness or ""off"" feelings, just pure well-being, a wonderful flavor and it is SO easy to ingest! I am thrilled to have finally found the perfect multi-vitamin for my body! Words cannot express how grateful and relieved I am! Oh yes, and the vitamin D supplement is also fantastic and I LOVE that there is 1000 IU in a single drop! Genius! Being healthy has never been easier, thank you, Athletic Greens! ",5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,April M.,1/26/22," I woke up one day and realized that I had accumulated an ocean of supplements with the corresponding subscriptions to go with them. Not only was this expensive but more times than not, I forgot to take them all, making them useless. My cabinet kept filling up as my wallet emptied out.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,John B.,1/26/22," AG1 is a fantastic product, and I don't mind paying more for a better product.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Stephanie B.,1/26/22," I love these greens. They are the only ones I’ve been able to stick with, I’ve tried and tossed many others over the years. AG1 taste fine in just water but my favorite is a couple ounces of orange juice, a handful of frozen mango, plus about 8oz water. It’s great first thing in the morning to start my day right and has completely replaced my coffee. Actually, I’m kind of mad about that last bit😉. Overall my skin is holding moisture better, my energy is stable, I’m able to keep up with my pre-teen son, and still play a little tennis. I feel better than I have in a long while. ",5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Vikrant M.,1/26/22," Small daily habit that feels like it has made a huge change. I feel more energetic - especially through the afternoon lull around 2 PM.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Shishir,1/25/22," I don't know if can I objectively say whether the product has worked or not, it's impossible to make any conclusion without a longitudinal blood test over a period of time.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Johnna W.,1/25/22," I have been enjoying the benefits of Athletic Greens for several months now. Every month I debate whether I am spending the money on it. So far I am still spending the money. But if things got tighter, I don’t know how long I could keep forking out almost $100 per month. Wish it was cheaper, but all in all, good product. ",4
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Wes W.,1/25/22, I believe my digestion has been progressively improving since the start of AG but the flavor/texture/finish needs a major improvement. I find forcing this stuff down every day is getting tougher and tougher. I know it is good for me but good lord it is hard to swallow. ,3
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Laura L.,1/25/22," My biggest concerns when ordering AG1 were that I would gag at the taste or suffer from some sort of stomach upset after ingesting. I've now been using it for 3 months and absolutely LOVE the product. I feel healthier, more energetic and almost crave drinking it, like my body is saying ""more please!"". I was dubious about trying such an expensive supplement that one has to subscribe to, but this one works for me and is worth every penny. I appreciate the company's mission and would recommend it highly! ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Stephen B.,1/25/22," Have used this for about 4 months exactly as recommended. It tastes OK but can’t say I felt any benefits. No notable change in energy, recovery time from exercise, etc. Price is outrageously high for a supplement. Plenty of better ways to spend $95/month. Live and learn… ",3

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Terrell D.,1/25/22, I will admit that I am a sucker for ads. The marketing is always genius. I believe that the product is what it says it is....a miracle. Well I am reminded of how gullible I can be. The drink itself doesn't taste so great. I find myself avoiding that morning drink and grit it leaves in my mouth. As for benefits....well again...it must work for others as I don't see or feel much change in myself. Onto the next fad! ,2

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Carolina P.,1/25/22," My morning routine has been next-levelled. Each morning, after my walk, I have my Athletic Greens with a dash of lemon or lime juice and it's the best way to get started. I've learned that if I use very cold water, and shake very well, it's not quite so grainy, but either way, I really enjoy the taste and the knowledge that it's doing me good. ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Keegan H.,1/25/22, The greens with vanilla is weird combo. I didn’t like the taste at all and texture is really grainy and gross. I tried for a month to get used to the taste and gagged it down. Influencers love it but it wasn’t for me. ,2
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Casey F.,1/25/22," Fire. Love this stuff frfr. Now I have a cabinet full off vitamins that idk what to do with 😂 It’s crazy bc it definitely works.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Ryan S.,1/24/22, Has been a great add to my morning diet ,5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Bryan W.,1/24/22, This seems to be a product of good quality. I left 3 stars over 5 because I didn't notice anything significant after taking it for a couple months. If there's no notable benefits then it's not much different from regular vitamins/minerals and twice the price. ,3

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Casey S.,1/24/22, I love waking up first thing and drinking my Athletic Greens. There is just something about starting your morning out right that gives you that boost to keep it going throughout the day. I also use the vitamins D drops as well. I was worried that AG wouldn’t taste good but not only is it great for you it taste good too. I highly recommend this to all of my friends. The travel packs are awesome because I am a bust mom of 2 who works full time and commutes so I keep them in my purse so I never have to skip a day if I had to run out of the house. ,5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Suzanne K.,1/24/22, I had high hopes that AG would help with my energy level and digestive system. I've been using it for several weeks and I can't say that I notice a shift in either. I feel about the same. I'm going to give it one more month and then reassess. It is quite an expensive product and too expensive to keep using without noticeable outcomes. ,4

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Jason B.,1/23/22, Been trying AG1 for a few months now. I can definitely say I have more energy and only drink one cup of coffee a day now. I don't get the common cold symptoms like running noses anymore. It's certainly helped me get through my 10 hour days at work. It tastes fresh and is super simple for someone who is always on the go. I recommend you try it if you are looking for something simple to take. No more swallowing pills! ,5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,John R.,1/23/22, It's a simple grab and go option that is Fantastic! It's also supports early hydration in the day and is certainly sustainable until lunchtime. ,5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,JENNIFER K.,1/23/22," I purchased AG because I knew I needed daily greens for healthy eating. With my new work schedule, a meal with fresh greens is not easy to achieve. Right now, if it's not easy it's not happening.

And I can relate to not always eating optimally while on the road and consuming all the essential vitamins and minerals necessary to maintain my health. So, I decided to give it a try! I was intimidated by the color at first. How can something green taste good?? The first sip caught me off guard, and I wasn’t sure this was for me but quickly grew to love the taste!! After a couple days I really started to enjoy my green drink and now look forward to it every morning!!! It’s SO delicious!!! After about a month I noticed my energy level change. I actually had lasting energy throughout my day!! Even if I don’t get a sufficient amount of sleep the night before I maintain a solid amount of energy all day long!! This is the most noticeable difference so far in my AG1 journey. I’m sure I’m experiencing other positive health benefits too, but having energy last through a long day at the office is mostly definitely my #1 takeaway!! Thank you, and keep up the good work!

The only reason I didn't give this review 5 stars is the storage tin and the shaker. Instead of spending the money on the fancy packaging, they should have spent $.07 more on each silicon O-ring for the storage tin and the shaker. Nothing worse than trying to shake your Greens at 5:45am in the dark only to have it leak all over you and the floor. I wish the O-rings fit each container better and didn't leak.

I kept it refrigerated and took it as recommended. I enjoyed the flavor, but ultimately, it made no noticeable difference for me in terms of energy, general wellbeing, or health. Unfortunately, $90 per month is too much for a multivitamin/greens supplement that may or may not be working. Hopefully it works better for others! ",1

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Brandon K.,1/13/22," I wasn’t unhealthy by any means before AG1…but adopting the habit of having a scoop every morning has snowballed into making a more conscious effort in making healthier choices all around. The physiological differences since adding AG1 have been subtle, but profound nonetheless. A little more natural & sustained energy without the crave for an extra coffee or snack, a little better quality of sleep, a little more “regular,” and as I stated above, a little more mental fortitude in making better/healthier choices vs submitting to a quick fix. Is it the sole savior? No…but it’s a great tool to have in the shed. I could do without a new plastic measuring scoop in each new bag and I do wish my AG1 bottle was glass vs plastic but…beggars can’t be choosers :) ",5

The reason for the 4 star review, instead of the 5 star, is due to the price. At around $93 a month the price for Athletic Greens (AG), in my opinion, is a bit too high. Especially for people who want to try it for the first time, $93 is a lot for a trial and probably turns a lot of potential customers away.

I’m using this since I’m tired of taking many pills and this claims to be a multi vitamin but I feel or see no changes since taking it daily over the past 5-7 months.

Within a week or two my skin was much dewier and healthier! That was the most obviously benefit that I’ve seen. I’ve been taking it for two months now and my skin is still looking great. Even though it works well, it’s definitely on the pricey side so it might not be sustainable long term. It would be more reasonable if it was in the $50-60/month range. ",4

I felt like a slave to swallowing pills that only upset my stomach and turned my urine bright yellow.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Lindsay,1/3/22," I bought Athletic Greens after seeing dozens of rave reviews from typical people (non-athletes). I was hopeful that this supplement would be true to advertising, but I was incredibly disappointed. The power does not dissolve well at all. I tried different amounts of water and mixing it longer, but it was consistently chalky. The taste isn't great, but I could deal with it if it wasn't so powdery. The texture is just awful. The supplement seems to support digestive health well, but for only that there are better options. I did not experience the energy boost I've seen advertised. Far too much money for a product that is subpar. ",1

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Matt H.,12/31/21," I began using Athletic Greens when I turned 30. I was feeling sluggish and tired and knew I needed a lifestyle change. I had tried numerous products similar to what I wanted out of Athletic Greens but was unable to build a habit in order to feel any change. Either the taste was not there or I didn’t have faith in the brand. Since starting Athletic Greens I have completely changed my lifestyle. After about two months since starting my Athletic Greens daily morning ritual, I had more energy and lightness in my body. I began running consistently, went back to the gym, started backcountry snowboarding more frequently, and have been much happier with myself in general. I know you may be thinking, “How can one scoop of Athletic Greens a day make you change your whole life?” But I can attest to the fact that when your body feels and functions like it is supposed to, you can then reap the benefits of its performance ability. I have discussed this change to many friends and colleagues who have since began their journey with Athletic Greens. I tell them, “If your body is your vehicle for life, why put 85 fuel in it, when you can fuel it with that premium 95!” Athletic Greens is that premium fuel. ",5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Erin H.,12/31/21," Tastes decent on it's own. Does NOT taste good when added to routine smoothie. There is a bit of a...garlic? Aftertaste. I wanted to love this more, but it doesn't seem to make a big difference for me. One of the primary reasons I wanted it was to incorporate into travel, but the large package obviously needs to be refrigerated after opening, so that doesn't work. The travel packs are nice but there are only a few of them. The storage container/shaker bottle/environmentally friendly packaging are great, so that's a good portion of my 4 stars.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Ken H.,12/28/21," I hit the gym 6 days a week and have well before (over a year) starting AG. I’m an absolutely average guy, not a meathead or a couch potato. I don’t follow any specific diet, eating relatively healthy while still enjoying snacks, desserts, etc. I started taking AG months ago to supplement dietary gaps and have been monitoring for differences I feel. I struggle to say I feel much different outside of feeling better hydrated due to the 12-16oz water I drink first thing every morning. I have yet to get a follow-up blood panel to look for changes there. I’m giving it a 3 out of 5 at the moment but will add another more accurate review in another few months. The 3 out of 5 is based on flavor (not bad, not good) and ritual habit forming aspect leading to better hydration. If you’re looking to feel different I’d say start a hydration routine BEFORE taking AG and then look for differences. If you’re looking for a “Nutritional Insurance” I’d have to say I do not yet have an opinion either direction. ",3

We would appreciate updates if the formula ever changes. Wouldn’t mind some more educational material about what’s in the product as well. Email newsletter would be great, talking about the ingredients and why it’s so good. I guess with all the products out there it’s just nice to be reminded why it is so good and why we should keep taking it. ",5

I have strange eating habits that I’m always trying to improve and that’s why I committed to this drink. I wanted to cover any gaps in my day-nutritionally. I don’t care how much it costs, It’s worth every penny to me. ",5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Lauren D.,12/23/21," This stuff is excellent! I love the packaging, the taste, and how it feels - you guys are great! However, it is a bit too costly for me - I'm in Canada! - and hasn't made me more exceptional, so I'm going to have to cancel my subscription and hopefully find something local that is similar to this experience. If it wasn't an issue of cost, I'd stay with you though! ",4

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Nicholas S.,12/23/21," Gave it a try, didn’t expect much. I was wrong. The first thing I crave in the morning is this stuff. The last thing I wanted was to have another somewhat pricey subscription but it was an easy choice to cancel some other ones for this. Energy, digestion, and for some reason stress all were positive effects I’ve had. I honestly don’t know if the stress one is even a thing but it started when I started having AG1 every morning. They got me, I don’t see myself ever stopping my subscription to athletic greens. Sure I wish it was a bit cheaper but whatever they are doing seems to make me feel better. I do a keto diet and lift almost everyday and I’m a full time single Dad as far as my lifestyle goes. It’s a must for me and has been for the last 3 months so far. ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Dane C.,12/22/21," As an athlete who is two months into an AG1 subscription, I thought AG1 would just be a simple and tasty way to get the right balance of nutrients and vitamins my body needs, but it's provided so much more than that. I'm feeling more energized, recovered, and ""regular"" than ever. Extremely happy with AG1 and will continue to subscribe and drink for the foreseeable future. ",5

I don't have a very big appetite and I'm concerned about getting enough nutrients on the daily. I was always trying to find the most well rounded multivitamin with quality ingredients.

This is the first time I’ve used a green powder consistently for a month and I enjoyed it, but I’m also checking out the competition, so I’m not sold.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,HEATHER M.,12/20/21," I’ve been using AG for a couple of months now. I like the feeling I get of starting each day off with a healthy drink. One good choice can lead to another, right? My only complaint is the sweetener that is added. I wish there was an unsweetened product to choose. The sweetener tastes like bubblegum which I really dislike. It can be mostly disguised by putting it in a smoothie but if you are drinking it with just water, the bubblegum taste is overwhelming. I have to chug the entire cup to avoid the taste. It doesn’t completely dissolve when shaken but that may be because I’m impatient and drink it without waiting. I’ll continue to use it with the hope that there will be an alternative flavor choice at some point. ",4

I liked the flavor and that fact that it mixes so easily and isn’t gritty like some other greens on the market. I just can’t get past the price.

I don’t want to give up my coffee as soon as I wake up. I’ve settled into taking it after I go to the gym (x3 weekly). That is what’s been working for me. I haven’t felt any benefits …….maybe because I’m not taking it everyday or because I eat a fairly good whole food diet already. I’m going to continue to receive my AG 1 order every second month for now. That interval may go down thought if I don’t consume my pouch before the next order comes. ,3

It became obvious when I was away for a few days and did not bring AG. When I came back, and started AG again, my body felt better. ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Jamie M.,12/16/21, It tastes pretty good. It doesn’t mix that well and is gritty when you get to the bottom I guess all drinks like this are but this is the most expensive one out there. ,3

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Ernesto G.,12/16/21," Easy to consume and a good daily supplement to nutrition. I have to believe that it has the nutritional value as stated but I have not noticed any difference in energy level nor general health. Consequently, the cost has become difficult to justify. ",3

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Lauren P.,12/15/21," I look forward to drinking this in the morning in cold water. It’s refreshing. Although, I personally do not mind green tasting powders— this one is very mild and reminds me of a pineapple. A long time green juicer, this makes me feel like I’m getting in the extra nutrients I am missing — and on crazy days where I miss getting in that celery juice— I’m okay with that because I’ve had my AGs.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Shane D.,12/15/21," I really like the fact that AG1 put almost everything I need into one product. About the only thing I can think of that it doesn’t have is Slippery Elm Bark for improving digestion. But other than that, it has most of the digestive enzymes, probiotics, fiber, and vitamins I need. is not good. It tastes like wheatgrass or algae to me, and I struggle with it. I have to add fruit juice or cocoa powder to it so I can mask the flavor.  ",3

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Sherry L.,12/15/21," I’ve tried numerous green powders. This one surpasses all the ones I tried. It’s expensive however I was paying around $50 a month for my probiotics and no longer need them. I was taking a multi as well that ran around $32 a month and no longer need that either. For the first time ever I’m going to the bathroom every morning without taking Metamucil or a softener, or colon cleanse. I’m very happy as is my boyfriend. More energy and my gut health is the best.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Cilla,12/15/21," The taste is horrible...I was expecting a green smoothie flavor (I like green smoothies), but instead it's got this artificial sweetness that's gag-worthy. Will not be having a second glass despite whatever health benefits it might offer! ",1
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Don A.,12/15/21, I Really like this product. It’s convenient and it tastes good. Almost has a slight bubblegum taste but still has a greens after taste.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Colter M.,12/15/21," This product is expensive. If you are an elite or wealthy athlete this may very well be fine, but for anyone else the cost far outweighs the benefit. If you want to be healthy, spend $45 on a gym membership and put the other $43 towards buying more fruits and vegetables. If the cost were half as much I would consider it worthwhile. ",3
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Jodi D.,12/14/21," I don't find this green 'juice' all that much different from other, really.

My overall sense of well being has moved from a 5 to an 8 and my workout performance has moved from a 6 to a 9. I love not having to take a ridiculous amount of supplements in pill form.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Brian R.,12/9/21," Second time my order was delayed to the point that I called to inquire where my AG was. The point of subscribing is that you don’t have to worry about dealing with where and when it will arrive. AG was very responsive and sent me additional AG pouches, so the customer service is excellent. ",3
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Sofia S.,12/9/21, I’m very particular about the supplements I take and I am completely sold on AG1. 2 months drinking it and can feel how great it works.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Kent S.,12/9/21," I love the product guys, your secret formula seems to give me more of a midday ""kick"" than the #2 product, but the price difference cannot justify the ongoing extra cost for me. Thanks. ",4
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Michael H.,12/9/21," I have more energy, better focus and quicker recovery since I have started taking AG every morning. It’s is the first thing I eat. While I was able to drink AG with just water, I found it taste better in smoothies or with vanilla protein. ",5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Sebastien B.,12/8/21," I enjoyed the taste, and what it had as ingredients and the amount of nutrition it provided. It’s only big downfall is the price. I understand that you get what you pay for, but competition is huge and I may get a product with slightly less nutrients, but I can get twice as many servings. If AG was cheaper in Canada, I would subscribe to it. ",4

I was looking for a full multivitamin that gave me the essentials, and this goes far and above. It tastes amazing (I don't have to choke it down), it's simple to incorporate into my morning routine (just add water and a scoop to a glass, mix, and drink!), and it has given me more energy. I highly recommend AG1 to anyone looking to supplement their already-mostly-healthy diet! ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Steve G.,12/8/21," I like the concept, and it tastes great. I have no problem with the product, it's the price. It's costs me about $100/ Month here in Canada.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Lara C.,12/8/21," I love this product. I feel so much better taking them and best of all - the taste is great. I've tried so many brands and always loath the taste, but not these. Finally a greens product I look forward to! ",5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Perry W.,12/8/21," 3 full months into having Athletic Greens everyday, I'm enjoying the routine and the taste of the shake (simple to prepare with water). One issue is the bottle that came with my order is hard to clean because of how narrow it is, so it often has residue in it despite thorough hand washing in the sink. Also the powder mixture is prone to 'coughing' up some powder when a new bag is opened in my experience so far, potentially causing a bit of a mess and losing some out of a bag. Otherwise the only other drawback is the price being a little high. If you can budget for it, it's a great option to start your day. ",3

Since I've started taking Athletic Greens, in about 2 months time, I noticed a marked improvement in how I am feeling, digestive system included, at the end of the day.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Darren E.,12/7/21," I've been doing AG for a couple months now, and have really enjoyed all the benefits it has to offer. I do intermittent fasting until noon each day, but have my AG (and some Vitamin D drops) at 11:30am to ensure that the first thing I put into my body (other than water and black coffee) is the most concentrated healthy thing I can do. It is SO much more convenient than having to mix up a veggie and fruit smoothie each day, because I don't have to buy the ingredients, prepare it and mix it each day, and so on. AG is fast, convenient, healthy, and doesn't taste terrible at all... in fact, I look forward to it, which is VERY unlike my experience with VEGA protein powder, because it made me gag literally every single time I had it... not joking, literally gagging. And the shipping of AG has blown me away, as I've never had ANYTHING ship so quickly and timely before! Not sure how you do it, but it needs to be recognized! ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Kevin V.,12/7/21, Great product ,5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Stacie R.,12/7/21, I have a hard time taking a bunch of different supplements. AG is an excellent solution to that and is more than just a multivitamin. The probiotics are a huge plus and I do get a nice subtle energy boost when I have it in the morning. ,5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Raul R.,12/7/21," Before I took my first AG1 I didn’t know what to think of how it would taste. Usually green juices aren’t that good (at least from my perspective). But I have to say I was surprised. It tastes pretty good and I love it, it’s very smooth on the stomach too. ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Max P.,12/7/21," Great supplement to wake up to before coffee and cover your multivitamin, pro and pre biotic all in one 🤙🏼 ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Bruce B.,12/7/21," I just bought the product was great. Al it of vitamins and biopics taken very combinatory. However, once you look back to how much you spent on the product then it’s hard to justify. $1200 a year on vitamins is just too much. ",3
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Natausha M.,12/7/21, There is an overpowering bubble gum taste that is just way too sweet for me. I found it difficult to drink due to the bubble gum flavor. ,2
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Joy R.,12/7/21, I’ve tried more greens powders than I can count and this one is the only one that tastes good!

Before, I used to take a menagerie of vitamin pills that always made me burp nasty vitamin tastes. Plus it seemed more like a chore to take my vitamins and I never knew if I was taking the right ones at the right time. AG1 takes the guess work out and it's more like a yummy cucumber melon treat first thing in the morning.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Nicholas J.,12/4/21, Everything about this product is pretty great except the price. $80 per month isn’t economically feasible for the majority of people. Especially for a green powder. If the price was half that I would most likely still be using this product. ,3

I used to make green juice every week but it became too time consuming, AG has been a good substitute. However, recently I'm beginning to think it's starting to give me an upset stomach/abdominal pain; I drink it on an empty stomach first thing in the morning and notice the pain. Has there been a recent change to the formula? I don't think I was experiencing this until recently. I did research saying it may pass, let's hope my gut flora adapts. Otherwise, I love your product.

It took me a few days to adjust to the taste, but it’s quite pleasant now.

Good product that I’ll keep using. ",5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Chris M.,11/30/21," Taken AG every morning now for around 3 months. Noticed a slow steady increase in energy throughout the day, faster recovery times, and general mental/physical well-being from morning to night regardless of workload. Only criticism I can say is that the scoops don’t fit in the bottles easily and I often spill some off the side. I’d recommend buying a small powder funnel for bottles to avoid the mess, or maybe AG could spent a few cents extra to provide one in startup kits. ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Colleen M.,11/30/21, cost prohibitive to sign up monthly ($88/mo). ,2
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Tim H.,11/30/21, Very happy with my AG1 purchases. Won’t say I feel a super impact yet but I actually crave these each morning. Plus I know my body is getting nutrients it wouldn’t normally get because I’m a picky eater. Purchased the individual packets the second time as they make traveling and storage very easy. Didn’t mind the pouch except as it gets towards the bottom your fingers tend to get covered in AG1 dust. Will buy again ,5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,James J.,11/23/21," It was nauseating even after 4 days, I just received an email advising users that they can make a smoothie which I was going to try doing that after my first experience with the taste like swallowing a glass of cheap bubble gum flavor, but the directions not to take with other foods as this inhibits uptake? Confused also mildly nauseated after my morning glass of slime. ",3

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Joseph M.,11/22/21, This product is too expensive given higher quality options at a lower price. ,1
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Tracey G.,11/22/21," I have only been using this for about 2 weeks so I am probably not as qualified to pass judgement as some people on here but here are my thoughts so far: 1. It isn't as easy to stomach as many people report. It is grainy and doesn't fully absorb into the water and since it is such a fine, gritty, powder, it lodges in the back of my throat and makes me cough. I put a scoop in 8-10 ounces of cold water and drink it down as quickly as possible. I was hoping it would be more of a sipping through the day kind of drink but definitely not. 2. The taste although not awful, isn't awesome. I can really taste the stevia and I'm not a fan of that. It makes it rather unpleasant. 3. The benefits - I like to think it is making me healthier. I try to be as healthy as possible without overdoing things, I do enjoy living life, I'm very active, busy and don't love to spend lots of time cooking, so I'm hoping this is helping. I haven't noticed anything like more energy, better recovery, etc. I am hoping with more use I will see these results and if not, I am just hoping that it is helping my body in some way. 4. The price - wow, as a Canadian, this is a huge cost for me and without seeing much benefit and not enjoying the taste or experience of drinking it, I'm not sure how long I can sustain these monthly payments.

Being a busy mom, I do not waste time on anything that does not have real value for me and drinking AG1 is my favorite way to start my day! It tastes good, digests well and is the easiest thing I do to take care of my body and self. ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Samuel G.,11/22/21, Definitely more expensive than I think is reasonable. The other main concern is having to take it on an empty stomach in the morning and waiting an hour before eating anything. ,3

Finally, I decided my health was worth 100 a month and I would give it a shot. Within a week I felt more energetic and vibrant. I figured it could be a placebo effect so I didn’t take it too seriously but here I am a month and half later and I can say for sure that AG1 is a major contributor to my well being and health. I feel great! Unless I go bankrupt I’ll be taking AG1 for the rest of my life. Highly recommended. ",5

I was spending 100’s of dollars every few months on high quality supplements. AG has replaced most of those in the best way. The taste is the best part. It’s delicious. I add it in water mostly but I also add it to my fresh made juice from time to time. I recommend getting the starter set for sure. Comes with a nice bottle for mixing and a nice container and scooper as well for refrigerator storage. I couldn’t be happier with this product and of course for the JRE for introducing it to me! ",5

The greens give me energy, regularity, and peace of mind knowing I am getting my daily essential vitamins and that is worth it!! ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Paul B.,11/18/21," I purchased AG1 in an effort to fill in the gaps of my eating habits and to improve my cycling performance. I’m not racing, or posting my times, or even going very fast these days. I ride to maintain my fitness and mental / emotional well-being. Since taking AG1 I haven’t bonked or had cramps. Both these things used to happen to me on longer, harder rides. I was also able to complete a week long solo bike trip. Even after being in the saddle for 5-6 hours, I’d wake up the next day ready to do it again. I definitely think AG1 made the difference between a suffer-fest and actually being able to enjoy it. Thank you! ",4
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Amanda C.,11/18/21, Overall I enjoy the greens. The taste could be better. The worst part is the packaging. They give you a bag to dump into your tin container and the power goes everywhere ,4

I have been disappointed with various interactions — or lack there of — with customer service reps, though.

I'm used to the green flavor of I was so disappointed with the taste due to the stevia and weird blueberry flavor. It takes like children's medicine no matter how I attempt to drink it. I've tried it with ice water, room-temp water, in a smoothie with other fruit, smoothie with just greens. It's terrible. I can't stomach it. But at least I have a canister? ",1

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Jenn S.,11/17/21," I absolutely love AG - it is the only supplement I take now and is so much easier than taking multiple vitamins. I usually drink it with water but sometimes I throw it in my smoothies when I'm in a hurry.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Carrie B.,11/16/21," I have been taking the greens for just over one month. I like the process as the jar, scooper and bottle are easy to work with, clean and perfectly sized for the amount of the drink. I find that it gives me a little clarity in the mornings and allows me the half hour to do other things before I make my coffee and breakfast. That half hour goes by really fast! I like the fact that I shouldn’t have to worry about taking other vitamins - as a 50+ woman, it’s important to get all those nutrients. Plus, I am not great about eating as many vegetables as I should. Tim Ferriss’s podcast got me on to this as other products that I have enjoyed. It’s a little pricey but I think anything that can become a healthy habit is worth the price. ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Jasenka,11/16/21," I used to buy these green powders from PCC all the time and never stuck with any of them for more than 1 week. There's something about AG that's hooked me - i'm the kind of person that loves gear and gadgets, and if I subscribe to something I'm probably going to try and get my moneys worth. AG subscription comes with a sweet green tin, scoop, and shaker bottle. Having the ""quick setup"" and dedicated equipment makes the routine much simpler and enjoyable - I always want to post IG stories of my morning routine but I'm pretty sure that would get old :D as for the actual ingredients, I'm not sure I notice that much of a difference in energy but I always had good energy - I am now down to 2 (from 4) cups of coffee each morning so that's something 😋 ",5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Gregg D.,11/16/21, As I started writing this I realized I had not had my first cup of coffee yet even though I’ve been up for 2 hours.. For the last 35 years I’ve had to have it as soon as I got up. I still love coffee but the need has very much diminished. I got a great energy boost when I started but that has tapered off. It seems a bit pricey but I am assuming that you get better absorption. ,5

AG1 prepares my body for the days activities whether it’s a workout or going to work. I’m work in the world of technology (radiology) so focusing and mental clarity is very important. Since AG1 I no longer have midday brain fog. I’m totally loving AG1. ,5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Dr. S.,11/15/21, I was turned on to Athletic Greens after multiple fitness podcasts and writers including Ben Greenfield and Tim Ferris continued to consistently promote it. There is some advertising wive's tale that it takes seven times to see an advertisement before your mind considers buying the product.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Alex M.,11/14/21," I don't feel any better or worse as far as I can tell after 1 month of the greens. It probably takes more time to feel it. Or maybe I'm just not that in tune with how my body feels. Likely some combination of both are at work here. Taste is fine, better than I expected given the color. r shaker. The opening is not much larger than the scoop, which makes it hard not to spill, or get the scoop wet on the sides. Also, the threads on the exterior of the shaker cause consistent dripping down my chest every time I drink out of it. Not big issues really, I can just use a different shaker. It just seems to me that they're wasting money by giving out the free shaker when it's not very practical or pleasant to use. ",3

I am an avid cyclist who suffered a serious crash over the summer that severely impaired my ability to eat, swallow, speak and so forth. As health/fitness was and is a lifestyle ...pre accident I took daily vitamins/supplements. Post accident my regular vitamin routine of swallowing pills small to ""horse size"" was no longer viable. Yet health and recovery were paramount. That is when I found Athletic Greens. I love the brand and of course have found in one serving a replacement for things I used to supplement and no longer could...and in an easily digested mix.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Carlos S.,10/20/21," Its nice to be able to quickly drink so much nutrients all at once. At first I thought it was too pricey, but after thinking about it I realized something. If I ate 1 salad a day it would probably cost 5 bucks and it wouldnt have all the Nutrients this product has. $5 times 30 days in a month equals $150. When I saw it like this I realized the value. 90 bucks seems like a lot but compare it to buying a quality salad daily at a restaurant or compare it to driving to grocery store a few times a month and then preparing it (washing, cutting etc). It would be nice it the price is lower but I wouldnt sacrifice quality to save a few bucks. ",5

The only thing Im not so crash hot on is the price but I understand many of the included ingredients are hard to grow or take a long time to produce which is why it's likely so expensive ,5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Benoit P.,10/5/21," Hi! I like Athletic Greens and it definitely helps my energy level and mood. But after 2 months, I still have a hard time getting over the taste (works better blended in a smoothie). I fail to understand why something so healthy has to taste so artificial. I would much prefer have a minty or lemony taste. Bubblegum might be better suited for a kid's product but as a grown up I would much more enjoy a more natural taste. Hopefully, we get more options in the near future. That being said, the benefits are worth the taste ;) ",4
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Sarah C.,10/5/21," I cringe at the price tag every month, but then never end up cancelling my subscription because I haven't ben able to find another powder that comes close to the content and quality of this one.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Ryan B.,10/5/21, Love the product ,4
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Nolan C.,10/4/21," Good product. Mixes nicely, tastes good for greens and has everything you need to keep you going. But the price Is simply preposterous..... There are many products that can be purchased from locally owned businesses for an average of about half the cost and provide identical benefits. Will continue using athletic greens for now to hopefully see the magical benefits that are spoke about from using this product consistently but truthfully I don’t feel any different taking these greens than I do the others I have in the past.

I usually get the product within 7 days which I find impressive since it’s being dispatched from the USA and I’m in Australia. I had another delivery about 2 weeks ago.

Some could be ""real"" physiological benefits; some could be placebo effect. What I can say is that I feel better, I sleep better, I have more energy, and my body often craves Athletic Greens at seemingly random intervals, even after I've already had it once in a day. The monthly subscription is a great value, and I keep a spare bag on hand to tide me over during postal delays and allow me to take an extra dose now and then.

And I recently had a week off from work and I was out of my routine so I stopped taking it ""unknowingly"". And I noticed I could feel a significant difference in my energy levels and my overall physical well-being. Felt sluggish and less coherent. It's a good product I would recommend it. Maybe a choice of flavors, after a while the flavor of it kind of just blends in and you don't really notice it anymore, sometimes it feels like a chore to drink it in the morning. So maybe some additional flavors or something to spice it up a little bit I'd recommend. Thank you ",4

Days that I'm a bit more tired, I drink another 8 ozs of AG and I feel revived without any hype or getters. Some time when I feel extremely thirsty I make another 8 ozs and the thirst disappears!! When I go skiing I definitely drink 8-10 ozs AG om the am and again when I return from skiing and I feel energized again and good to go for the night :-) I'm 62 so you have an idea of how to compare.

I compared so many -none of the others are even close. Thank you Athletic Greens for being conscientious in making such healthy product. ,5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Diane S.,9/17/21," Athletic Greens is fantastic. Two things I think need a bit more explanation. First, I find using half a scoop after the first month is much better for me. Let’s be honest…the taste is not that inviting. Half a scoop in 8 oz of water goes down much better. The second glitch is the 30 minute wait after drinking. I do it but wonder if it really makes that much difference. What I think I might do in the future is add Athletic Greens to my morning protein Shake. This will help me get started fast on days I am short on time.  ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Jennifer J.,9/17/21," I love this product. I've been taking AG for just over 2 months now every morning. It's was easy to add into my morning routine and it was surprising not hard to take down either. I love knowing I am giving my body the best vitamins and minerals that it needs to properly function.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Elizabeth L.,9/14/21," .....that you would get all the benefits of Athletic Greens via your daily food intake, and even if you took supplements, you'd need to spend a lot of money (plus it would take up a lot of room in your cupboard). I took the time to read through, and write down, the benefits of each of the 75 ingredients and WOW....so impressive! Couple that with a yummy taste (I was expecting it to taste like swamp water lol) and I can sincerely say that I look forward to every morning and starting it with AG. I cannot recommend this product enough. My ONLY peeve is that, since I'm in Canada, unless I ask for my shipping to be changed in my subscription, I won't get my greens in time to take them back to back without interruption. Otherwise 10/10! ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Nicole G.,9/14/21, I cannot believe how much of a difference Athletic Greens has made in how I feel everyday! When I first received my greens I was afraid that it would taste horrible but to my surprise it wasn't disgusting.

Looking forward to how I feel in another month of two of consistently getting the nutrients that I need! ,5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Megan L.,9/14/21," I want to like this product. I’m sure it is beneficial, but the taste is terrible and super grainy that makes me gag. Probably much better in smoothies to hide the taste and texture, but I haven’t tried that yet. ",2

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Elizabeth B.,9/13/21," I know when something works when I run out of it and miss it in my daily routine. I have taken Athletic Greens for years, and feel great! When I first started using the product, I worried about the cost. Was it REALLY worth it? So, I tried other cheaper, less tasty brands. THAT was more of a waste of money than anything. I didn’t feel at my best. Swimming was more of a chore. My knees were more creaky. Seriously! I could feel the difference when I went back to taking Athletic Greens regularly. It also helps keep my weight in check. I just know when preventive maintenance works and I feel healthy and right. Athletic Greens keeps me at my optimum and is worth every penny. ",5

By the end of the day, if I haven't had my morning scoop, I am dead tired physically and mentally.

My body craves it now! I went about a week between orders (after a month of taking it daily) and I could feel a difference in overall energy and feeling good. This doesn’t give me an energy “boost” like a lot of products- I just feel more sustained energy throughout the day, cause I feel better. So, as long as I can afford it, it has become a staple. ",5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Meredith S.,9/8/21," I saw AG on social media, read the ingredients, and thought why not give it a try. If it tastes good and makes my body feel good, I could give up the numerous supplements I was taking. A customer service rep sent me 5 travel packets for free to try the product before committing. First off, it is green but doesn’t taste like liquid salad; it has a hint of sweetness which I love. I make this everyone morning with water while getting the kiddos ready for school. After my morning walk I refill my AG bottle with ice water and go about my day. Without being graphic, I have no constipation, it gives me the energy boost needed so coffee is optional, and my head feels clear rather than foggy. I am a subscriber to AG and look forward to the long term benefits. ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Frances P.,9/8/21," So Tim Feriss recommends them and I thought I'd try them hesitantly because of the price. A couple of mornings later, I could not stand the thought of not being able to drink them every morning! I'm 45 turning 80 and my body has decided to go downhill. I put it down to having been born a preemie. But drinking Athletic Greens every morning has been a game changer for me. I just feel better, lighter, more solid than I usually do when I don't drink them. Especially through the pandemic and the stress and the illness, AG has helped me cope and gets me ready for the day. I plan to keep on drinking for as long as I can! ",5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Richard L.,9/8/21, I have tried other green juices and they all have their own dominating flavor. Athletic greens use pineapple.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Derek M.,9/8/21, Product tastes pretty good. Largely I feel like I have had more sustained energy and mental clarity. I would probably relate it higher if it was cheaper. For a monthly cost the price is quite high. ,3

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Mandy B.,9/5/21, My daughter-in-law raved about Athletic Greens so I finally decided to try them. Two an half weeks after I had my first drink I realize I had more stamina and my brain fog was gone. It took me a couple of days to analyze what I was doing different then I realized it was about three weeks earlier when I added the Athletic Greens to my morning routine. My 83 year old mother is here this weekend so I am going to have her trying them and if she will give it a month I have an extra bag for her to take home. She is working 7 days a week running her own furniture store and she loves it but her memory has slipped this past year.

If the texture/mixability ever changes, I'm happy to jump right back in and re-start my subscription. I'm so sorry....I really wanted to love these! ",3

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Liz C.,7/22/21, I started this and time restricted eating a month ago to help with digestive issues and have seen rapid improvements to my health. A lot of the unpleasant side effects of IBS have been minimized when before they were distractions at best and crippling at worst. I would recommend this to others with digestive issues! I'll admit that for the first week I found the taste absolutely terrible because I have always hated stevia but powered through because I knew it was good for me and my partner who also started taking it thought it was delicious so I figured it might be like how some people hate cilantro. I drank it daily and within about a week it started tasting really good to me. I drink it with 8oz of water and ice. If you don't like it at first please keep trying!! ,5

I wish they could work on the flavor some i get that chalky taste like you do with proteins. The price point in my opinion is pretty expensive but if they say it does what they say it will do then I can agree with the price. Only other negative is the cup amount for the 12 ounces of water it leaves behind some residue, not a big deal but for being almost $100 a bag how much money is getting left in the shaker?

A bit pricey and I wish the packaging was better. It's difficult to get all the powder out when you get towards the bottom, and it always get some on my hands when I reach down. Really wish it came in a box instead of a pouch or some other type of container that is easier to get powder out of. ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Linda B.,7/15/21, I just haven't seen any difference in any area. I will be cancelling my subscription. ,3
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Karyn K.,7/15/21," I've been drinking my Athletic Greens regularly now for the past month. At first I was skeptical, but now I'm a believer. At the very least I am getting a good 16oz. of water in first thing in the morning, but honestly I feel like I have more energy right from the start of my day. I drink my greens, then I swish the bottle with another 8 oz. It's a good ritual for me (I love standardization of my route in the morning!) and I do feel more awake and ready to go. I still follow up with a cup of coffee - I still love the warmth of a morning cuppa - but it has changed my ""stumble into the kitchen and fill up the mug"" to: drink some exciting greens and feel energized! ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Michael L.,7/15/21, My wife and I have been sharing the daily dose for 2 months and are noticing improved digestion and regularity. We already have a good balanced diet full of fresh fruits and veggies. So decided to share the dose to save money. The recommended monthly cost per person is out of our price range. We'll keep using Athletic Greens for now. ,3
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Deborah S.,7/15/21," Super easy to make, mixes really well, no grit, tastes great! Easy to get my greens in first thing every day, even before coffee! ",5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Kirsty N.,7/15/21," I really like this product. The ingredients are great and the overall quality is high. However, I wish there was an option to purchase the product without Stevia, as I prefer to avoid artificial sweeteners. I was also disappointed to receive notice that the 20-day travel pack subscription is being discontinued. Finally, although this is relatively minor, the lid to the ceramic container doesn’t fit (and a search through the Facebook group shows that this is a common issue). Seems like an easy problem to fix. ",3

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Benjamin K.,7/15/21," So far so good! I take this first thing in the morning. I do think I have felt more energized all day since having started taking this. Other than that, I just feel healthier (maybe a little bit of placebo? Too weird?). Anyway… I’m still going to take Athletic Greens.  ia. See how it’d be without the sweetener. ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Christopher R.,7/15/21, First rate product. Only issue is the delivery outside the US is a bit unpredictable due to COVID ,5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Charlotte P.,7/15/21, Athletic Greens triggered my acne is a way I haven't seen since... the last time I tried a spirulina supplement nearly a decade ago. If your skin is sensitive-- Avoid this! ,1

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Constance M.,7/14/21," Since I've been taking Athletic Greens every day, I've had significantly less digestive discomfort. I have mild colitis and the daily dose seems to help a lot with keeping me comfortable and regular. The containers and scoop that accompany Athletic Greens are also beautifully and functionally designed. I'm extremely pleased with the product overall. Thanks. ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Josh D.,7/14/21," I think some information when you sign up for the subscription on how long it takes to get your greens after the order is placed would be helpful. I got the travel packs which i used this month so i pushed by renewal back a week. However, i'm now seeing that 3 days after my order was placed, my green still have not shipped which means i will have to go a couple days without any greens. A breakdown of how long it take once ordered would have been helpful. Everything has been great so far! ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Heidi R.,7/14/21," I know to keep it clean, the taste may have to be sacrificed, but that is my only negative really. I haven't been taking them long enough to see a difference just yet but feel good during workouts so I am going with it!! ",4
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Erma T.,7/14/21," Love taking my daily Athletic Greens. It's one of the ways I am investing in my health—and I feel good about that.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,William H.,7/14/21," The taste is far superior to any other greens powder I've tried, and the nutritional profile is very good. I can't say that I've noticed any difference in health or energy since I get pretty good nutrition without it. The high cost makes it difficult to continue buying every month. ",3

I’m happy with the product and I think this will remain part of my daily routine moving forward. I really enjoy the taste, which I found surprising. I don’t like the taste of most vitamin drinks and green juices, but AG found a way to keep the flavors subtle, crisp and refreshing without being bitter.  ",4

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Chrstopher L.,7/14/21, Love this product! Just wish it would ship with UPS/FedEx instead of USPS. Hate going days without my re up because the mail system is slower ,5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Kristen H.,7/13/21," We LOVE these, my husband and I both drink these every morning and we genuinely feel good after! Only giving 4 stars for the slow shipping and lack of free shipping for auto-ship. If I’m spending 156 a month shipping should be included in my opinion! The product itself is delicious and my body loves it! ",4

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Matt L.,7/13/21, Eh I tool these over a month. I noticed very little nutritional improvement. I did notice it stifled hunger better than my usual supplement but not $100 a bag better. ,2
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Cristina A.,7/13/21, Athletic Greens is so refreshing! I love that it doesn't taste too much like typical green drink mixes. I love the taste and I like to add creamer sometimes! Weird but delicious! ,5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Amanda W.,7/13/21, I’ve been enjoying Athletic Greens for a month now. I expected it to a challenge to drink each morning but it’s remarkably smooth and tastes really good - not overly earthy. If taste or texture is holding you back - don’t let it. ,5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Monica H.,7/13/21," Love the product, but believe the shipping cost is excessive. Many other supplement providers offer free shipping with purchase amounts less than $77. Eats up my $ savings. I doubt that it really costs $9 to ship that bag. ",4

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Nicole R.,7/12/21, Would give this 5 stars for flavor and dissolvability/texture! The only thing I would like to see is a high quality better dissolving fiber added so you can still get a good fiber dose with it. ,4
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Kaarin S.,7/12/21, I use these everyday and they make a huge difference in my mood and energy levels. I highly recommend them! ,5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Kate E.,7/12/21," I really like the athletic greens, and the ceramic container is great, but my only complaint is that is kicks up green dust SUPER easily. You inhale it every time you make it. Maybe if there was a way to modify the container so there's less pressure when it's opened to make less of a plume of powder. ",4
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Cathy R.,7/12/21, So far so good ,5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Jessica C.,7/12/21," For the first time in my life, I'm not sore mere hours after my workout, and I don't spend the next day hobbling around swearing that I'll never lift another weight. With this and other benefits, I can get over the grainy texture and alfalfa-like taste.  Greens may not always make the cut. ",4
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,sahoo,7/12/21, Nice product ,4
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Kerri C.,7/12/21, So happy with the changes I've felt mentally and logistically since taking Athletic Greens.. can definitely notice the difference if I miss a day. The only negative is the expensive price but whilst I can afford it I'll be sticking to them. ,4
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Jason B.,7/12/21," Athletic Greens has really been more valuable than I ever imagined. Aside from the health benefits, which I can go on and on about - vitamins, minerals, probiotics etc. But the fact they make it so easy to turn it into a daily habit. I've started stacking other healthy things alongside this habit (working out, reading before bed, etc) and I've literally never felt better. ",5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Sarah F.,7/11/21," I love juicing, but I just can't make the time. I love that greens give me more quality nutrition to keep me on track. I use it as a 10 AM or 2 PM snack to keep my cells powered. ",5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Larissa S.,7/11/21, I wish they informed about the direct withdrawal of money on the next order never had a heads up and my card was charged 80$ Without my approval ,3
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Stephen C.,7/11/21, It is a good product however it is kind of expensive ,4
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Jeanne M.,7/11/21, I can’t stand the taste or texture of this superfood supplement drink. I went ahead and bought a different brand with a much more palatable flavor. ,1
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Alex R.,7/11/21, I enjoyed the flavor of Athletic Greens and drank it consistently for the two months however it ends up being a bit too expensive. I didn’t feel as though I ever get any performance gains or improved gut health as claimed. Maybe I would’ve had I continued but the cost of the subscription on top of all the taxes and shipping costs make it so it becomes unnecessary. ,3
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Angel O.,7/11/21, My body loves it. ,5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Dylan T.,7/11/21, Delivery timeliness and food quality are very good. At least compared to other food delivery services I’v tried. Packaging is ECO friendly and well done. ,3

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Ian B.,7/10/21," I'm loving Athletic Greens. I've been using them for two months now and have definitely noticed a subtle difference in how I feel. I have more energy every day, and drinking them first thing in the morning has absolutely benefited my gut health. Also, if you happen to have one too many drinks the night before, they settle everything down in the morning. I'm also able to delay my first meal of the day because the greens provide so many nutrients I find I don't have to eat first thing in the morning anymore. It's also just really great to know that no matter what my diet happens to be on any given day, I'm at least getting a very powerful baseline of nutrients in my system consistently. I can't recommend them enough! ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Buist H.,7/10/21, It’s been great I can tell the difference hi I gave your five the package to a friend and she loved it and is going to order AG ,5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Alex H.,7/10/21, Far too expensive. No significant difference in how I feel over taking a standard multivitamin. Taking as directed by mixing into cold water does not taste good. The water gets a gross foam on top and is unpleasantly gritty. ,2
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Carol K.,7/10/21, Tastes great and I feel great. ,5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Tracy B.,7/10/21, I love this product. I drink it every morning. I was surprised by how good it tastes. I recommend it. A delicious way to get my greens. ,5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Teresa M.,7/10/21, That is the most amazing part of greens no caffeine jitters because you need more energy these greens give it in a healthy way. My nails have never in 67 years grown so fast and looked so good! So many products claim delivery this is the first one I’ve taken that truly is giving me results. My only complaint is I wish I had started them earlier! ,5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Scott M.,7/10/21, I work in the sun all day. Athletic greens are a great way to get some healthy stuff in your guts when you don’t feel like eating. You have to keep it cold tho. ,5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Marilyn H.,7/10/21," I love that AthleticGreens is widely inclusive. I’ve always reacted to supplements and been confused about which ones my body uses. AthleticGreens certainly has many ingredients that my body needs. To date, after about 4 weeks, I can tolerate 1/2 teaspoon daily. I’ll be interested to see if this dose can increase over time. Or, will my GI start to reject even this low dose. Vertigo and unstable stance/walking are the main reaction I notice. Unsettling and disappointing. I remain hopeful that a happy balance can be found. ",3

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Kent T.,7/10/21, It’s really sad that I can’t get this product to a similar price as comparable products as there are many. The only thing separating is taste. The unbelievable social media hype is what really drives the demand for this product. While I do like this product I will easily jump when a competitor finally wises up and matches taste. In the meantime the owners and their supporters will rake in the cash. ,3

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Amanda,7/9/21," I've waited about 6 months to write this review, to be completely certain of the change AG's has made for me. I had been on medication for chronic constipation for several years and as a young 50 something year old energetic woman this was not great. Within 3 days of starting AG's I had stopped all medication and now apply a word to myself that I never thought I would ... I'm REGULAR. Other reviews cover energy, clarity, nutrition. But I wanted to add this to the mix. ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Dawn W.,7/9/21," I love the taste but I’m very sensitive to the ingredients and get IBS symptoms. I even tried a half of the dosage but still problems, so I take just a little each day. Will try to reintroduce it on my days off. ",2

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Jonah Z.,7/9/21," The nutrition in the Athletic Greens are beyond exceptional; however, the taste when using it alone with water or other milks isn't great. Adding into a shake with other foods will reduce the bad taste, and that is what I have been doing. Overall, I will continue to use this for it's nutritional benefits of my sport soccer. ",4
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Denisce C.,7/9/21, It's been about 2 months since I started drinking athletic greens daily. I felt more energy initially and no longer felt the need to drink coffee. I still drink it daily but really don't feel like there are any other postiive effects like other reviewers have mentioned. I'll try for another month and see how it goes. ,3

Would highly recommend!!! ,5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Taylor T.,7/8/21," So far they are fine. I have only been using them for a few weeks and have not felt any real differences. They taste fine, not great but some people suggest this takes at least a month or two for real results so I am going to keep trying it. Although these are way too expensive for no real results, it's kinda obscene how expensive this is given that it is supposed to help people. ",3

In this time I have noticed that my energy level during the day is better than it was before, even when I was taking supplements in the form of pills and gummies. I attribute this largely to the better absorption that Athletic Greens has. o considers vegetables and fruits to be a complete waste of stomach space better allocated to things I like to eat, Athletic Greens are a way to compensate for that.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Abby C.,7/8/21," I have been using AG for one month. The taste and texture have not bothered me at all, and I have not had any negative side effects. (The worst part is waiting the 30 minutes each morning before my morning cup of coffee!) I'm feeling like my fingernails are getting stronger, but that may be too early to confirm. My fingernails have always been very rough and brittle. I do feel that it has helped with my chronic constipation. The travel packs have come in very handy this month. I will continue AG. ",5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Paul S.,7/8/21, Been taking a multi vitamin and a few goli acv gummies for years now. Always feel great. Saw this and thought I’d give it a try. Definitely not worth the $$ or the hype. Been a month now and not nearly anything like I’d expect from such a “miracle” product. I’ll try the next month since I didn’t cancel in time.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Michael C.,7/7/21, Been using AG's for 2 months now. Seems like a good nutritional supplement but it's expensive in bulk and the travel packs are even more expensive. I haven't noticed any benefit yet that would justify the expense. I'm giving it another month but will be looking for a less expensive alternative. It might help if AG had some kind of rewards program or didn't charge for shipping on top of the $77 per month for the product. ,3

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Bracken M.,7/6/21," I’ve done two months of athletic greens and I have noticed a slight difference. I know I do not get enough vegetables in my diet so I believe this helps. Having everything all at once is a different story. Much like taking a multivitamin, the body will only absorb so much before it gets rid of the rest. This may or may not be the same as athletic greens. The one thing I enjoy the most is the amount of variety of fruits and vegetables it has in the powder. Most other products only has a fraction of the ingredients. ",4

I can’t really prove that my health benefited from the probiotics, vitamins, adaptogwns, and various nootropics, but I would be willing to take the advice of those I trust when they says it’s good “insurance” for the body, if — and this is a big of — the cost were not exorbitant. I could do without the fancy packaging, if the price leveled out to $1/day. Maybe a $1.25. As it stands, I’m willing to eat fermented foods, dark leafy greens, and other nutrient rich Whole Foods. US-based supplement makers deliver a similar product for 1/3rd the cost. ",2

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Justin K.,7/5/21," So far, not super impressed. I've had two shipments delivered and both times the pouch was delivered in a flimsy USPS padded envelope, which allowed the pouch to get quite hot during transit.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Leslie B.,6/22/21," I am really enjoying having this in my fridge. I am not a big supplement person and I am a stickler for quality ingredients so this is one product I actually don’t mind paying extra for. It is a very expensive supplement so I don’t buy it all of the time but during the Warner months and when I am more active, I have enjoyed adding it into my routine to help me stay hydrated and add some extra vitamins, polyphenols and antioxidants.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Susanne T.,6/22/21, I LOVE the fresh flavor and feel more energized and healthier when drinking it. But it does not ever fully dissolve in water and you need to constantly shake the bottle. And it is just way to expensive. Not sustainable ,3

I enjoy the taste, but most importantly, I simply feel better when I take them daily. I have loved them so much I have referred a few friends to try them. I have not been pleased with the way they handle friend referrals, as they do not automatically credit your account. I have contacted them each time to ask about my rewards and have spent so much time trying to get them. This is disappointing and inconvenient.

It didn’t do what we hoped for her as the diagnoses was wrong to begin with so I had extra packs and decided to try it. Oh my lord !!! The amount of energy and the degree of alertness I had was just amazing. For twenty years I have struggled to keep my nutrition up and now I take two glasses a day of the Athletic Greens and I make it through the day. Maybe you should market this to gastrointestinal doctors!! I have to admit that the thought of drinking this (I’m sorry about the description) nasty looking green drink lol made me want to gag because I thought it would taste nasty but it’s actually very thin and not gaggy at all. It has a hint of mint and I always drink it with cold water and stir it up very well. I highly recommend this product to others especially those who have had a gastric bypass!! ",5

I think AthleticGreens is responsible for contributing about 70% to these results. A pleasant and unexpected observation has been that in the past, whenever I changed what I eat often pops out during the next day or so accompanied by various announcements and stylistic expressions. The effect of AthleticGreens on my digestion and excretion has been so good that the wild and unexpected rides on the poop deck, from eating the goofy stuff that is normally on my menu, have practically vanished, i.e., tp cost during the pandemic panic has been nil.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Kristen A.,6/7/21," Athletic Greens is the most well rounded supplement that I’ve come across. I had been researching vitamins and probiotics for a while looking for the right products, when I came across AG which is an all in one. I think that AG is a reasonable price considering the amount of supplements you’re actually getting. There has been all kinds of improvements in my body that I had never gotten from other vitamins. Just after a month my hair has grown somewhere between 1 and 2 inches, I have a lot more energy, I feel cognitive improvements.. I love the product and I will continue buying it monthly. ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Mike,6/7/21," I love the idea behind Athletic Greens, there is no way I could eat the amount of fruit and vegetables needed to get all of the micronutrients contained in the product. That said I question whether the dosages are of any clinical effectiveness as there is very little transparency in the amounts of the ingredients contained in each complex. For example the ""Digestive Enzyme and Super Mushroom Complex"" list the quantity for the total amount of ingredients but doesn't include specifics per ingredient. The total amount of ingredients for the complex is 154mg but depending on the study, the clinically effective dose of reishi is 6 to 12 g extract daily. Ganopoly (a Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharide extract) in doses up to 5.4 g daily (equivalent to 81 g of the fruiting body) for 12 weeks has been used in a few clinical trials.* The entire complex is no where near that dose and reishi specifically is the second to last ingredient listed so I can only assume there is barely a fraction of the effective dose. This leaves one to wonder how Athletic Greens determined the quantity of each ingredient to include, and was it based on any science regarding clinical effectiveness, or is it all marketing to just be able to say they include these really powerful ingredients regardless of effectiveness? I like to think I'm benefitting from Athletic Greens, but considering that I don't really feel any different when I take it, do I just need to double my dose, or considering the miniscule amounts of some of the ingredients would it not even matter and have I been sold on marketing hype alone? I'd love to see more transparency in the quantities of each ingredient as well as support for the dosages they included, otherwise for the nutrients they do quantify, I can get a comparable multivitamin for fraction of the cost. ",3
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Spero M.,6/7/21, Love the taste and definitely feeling great from the nutrients. Only issue was the delay in getting the welcome kit with the ceramic container.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Ryan C.,6/7/21," At first I was skeptical about trying Athletic Greens due to the price. After a recent surgery that limited the amount and types of food I could have I decided to give it a try to keep myself from becoming nutrient deficient. The taste was different at first and I am not adverse to greens at all, but now I crave the taste every morning. I take it first thing in the morning and almost instantly feel an energy boost similar to a cup of coffee that lasts throughout the day. I feel better overall and a lot more focused. I still wish the price was a little better, but its something that I don't want to stop taking as there seems to be so many benefits. I'm one month in and definitely recommend it. ",5

It's really expense. By the time you pay tax and shipping it's nearly $100 for a drinkable vitamins. While I can understand paying that price if it actually gave me more energy, nourished my skin and hair, or benefited my gut health but it didn't. Save your money. ",2

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Jessica J.,6/6/21," I love the ease of ensuring that I’m getting sufficient nutrients every morning and it really tastes surprisingly good. Only minor gripe is that since I mix it in water (via vigorous shaking), I can’t ever get it to fully dissolve, so there are always some powdery dregs in the bottom. I’m sure it wouldn’t be an issue if I was up for drinking it in a smoothie. ",4

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Christopher R.,6/6/21," Skepticism and doubt ran through my mind when considering trying out Athletic Green; However, knowing my typical diet (white rice and a protein) and a generic multivitamin I knew that my body needed something more. So, after reading about and comparing this product to others of its kinds I decided to purchase and give it a shot. After receiving my first pack and trying it out I was relieved that it at least tasted good. Jump to day 3 and wow what a difference in my energy, focus, and overall mood. I was able to push myself more during my workouts both in cardio and lifting. I started feeling less fatigued through out my day despite my increase in workout intensity. And overall, my I felt good about my day and most importantly myself. I am in the middle of my second month and have no intention in stopping. I love Athletic Greens!! ",5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Brookes M.,6/5/21," The greens themselves seem fine (apple juice really helps) but the bags, scoop and provided water bottle are truly a nightmare to use. Green stuff gets EVERYWHERE no matter how careful one is. That is the worst water bottle I’ve ever used. It leaks so much. Sticking my hands into that pouch is so gross and my fingers get covered in green powder that then gets all over my kitchen. Please, please improve your packaging and bottle for a better user experience. I spent like $200 on this stuff for ONE MONTH and feel strongly it shouldn’t be this horrible to use. ",1

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Levi A.,6/5/21, I love this product but I have had a bad experience overall so far. My first order was for the greens and container combo. It took much longer than expected for the order to ship and arrive and the container didn’t even show up. When I asked when the container would arrive the support staff said I needed to make another order and it would be shipped with that but I’ve already paid for the container. I wish to continue purchasing and using athletic greens but only because I think it is a quality product. I have yet to receive my container by the way. Or my next order of greens even though I reactivated my subscription. ,2
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Jesse S.,6/5/21," I love my Greens. They are a great way to start my day, and unlike most supplement drinks, the taste is actually really enjoyable! My only reason for a 4* instead of 5 is that the drink is a bit gritty, as all of the scoop doesn’t dissolve. This isn’t enough to make me stop by any means, I just wish I knew this going in! ",4
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Donna L.,6/5/21," I enjoy the greens I have them first thing in the morning, tastes good I add a little bit of orange juice. I feel my overall health has improved since taking the greens 3 weeks now ",4
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Brandon S.,6/5/21," The powdered greens themselves are a 9/10, I’ve been subscribed for a few months now and have only had a positive experience so far. This issue is the shipping. Yes, it’s enough to drop this by two stars because 9$ shipping is expensive enough as it is and yet, the timing is even worse. The shortest amount of time I’ve waited for a shipment of greens to arrive has been 6 days. There have also been two separate occasions where the shipment was said to have arrived and did not get to me until the following buisness day. As a side note, I’m not including the processing time before the product is shipped, only the time from the initial email notification letting me know once the greens themselves have been shipped out to me. From the order date, the average time thus far is well over a weeks time, and for 9$ that seems entirely unrealistic. I’m sure they have an excuse for the delays, most likely the enduring yet overly relied on “covid delay” copy paste excuse that everyone uses but any normal person knows is no longer the case. For now, I can afford the shipping cost. But I’m sure there are many who cannot, and I myself am not a fan. If there was a legitimate reasoning behind this, like a private shipping partner, I’d understand. But this is being shipped through USPS and takes over a week to arrive from the purchase date, just an observation. Might want to let people in on the secret behind the cost, thanks. ",3
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,George D.,6/5/21," Simple to prepare and tasty with a wide variety of breakfast fruit juices, my Athletic Greens supplement is my primary choice of nutritional supplement for feeling GREAT all day long. I mix it according to instructions, with one scoop of mix added to 8 oz. of water. I then add 8 oz. of V-8 Fusion peach/mango or strawberry/banana; or 8 oz. of apple juice.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Adele B.,6/4/21, The product was good not great. I ordered the welcome packet through an online influencer link. I didn’t get all of the items that were promised. I reached out to the company twice and although they were polite it was basically “keep paying us monthly if you ever want to receive what we should have sent to begin with”. For the amount I was paying monthly the service could have been much better and the response should have been” sorry we forgot to send you everything we will have that right out to you”. Instead I was told they would send the missing item in my next delivery. Didn’t come. I reached out again and got the same reply. I cancelled because basically they were never going to send it. It’s a small thing however it’s the little things that count in customer service. ,3

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Kathrine M.,6/3/21," It was hard to tell if the price was worth it. I don't think Athletic Greens are ripping people off and making large greedy profits or anything, I just got the feeling that I could use that money on more organic produce to get extra nutrients and also fibre. I eat fairly healthy, so I did not notice any improvement in my energy or health. The taste was off-putting and I didn't like that there's stevia in it. Personally I'd rather have it with zero sweetness and then add it to a smoothie - in which case as may as well just take supplements and have a smoothie if I'm trying to up my nutrients. I don't know. My partner just ordered some and is going to do his own test. I also didn't receive the container that was meant to come with the starter pack.. there was a note to say they were out of stock and would send it at ta later date, it's been over a month since the order and it never came.

Lastly it didn’t dissolve well in water. There was a buildup at the bottom and I had to constantly shake or stir it so it wasn’t all at the bottom by the end.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Cari I.,6/1/21," I love my greens and admit I was skeptical at first. Today I look forward to starting my day with a quick green drink... i’m partial to mixing with coconut water and vanilla bone broth protein powder. Surprisingly delish. I’m not a fan of paying shipping every month for scheduled orders, and still have not figured out how to get my orders here with consistency (delivery timelines are inconsistent) so I hope AE will come up with a better approach for Canadian clients on the west coast.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Rae S.,5/29/21, Good taste and energy boost in the morning. Only small issue is not receiving my next shipment before I run out if greens. Usually only a day or two so not a huge deal. I prefer this to taking pill supplements! ,4

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Sierra R.,5/28/21, Wonderful customer service. I had ordered the welcome kit but was unable to get all items in the kit. It was due to shortage of supply of the ceramic jars and shipping delays due to Covid19. I got a card along with what items were available in the welcome kit stating the shortage and that as soon as they came in they would remember to send me the completed welcome kit. With two months of new greens orders they would continue to email me saying they would send the ceramic jar when it was available. Awesome at keeping the lines of communication open! My third order of greens came this month and AG kept their word and sent the welcome kit with all items included! ,5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Luke A.,5/28/21," The only issue I have is with your bottle. It makes a mess everywhere. Don’t use those flimsy rubber seals in the cap. If it falls out, the entire contents will spill out. Even if the rubber seal is in place, every time I take the cap off, a couple ml’s of liquid falls out the cap and onto my seat, white cloths and so on. Don’t be cheap. You want people to advertise your product right? Well make a cap that makes people actually wanna use the bottle. Also juice gets underneath it and that becomes a manufacturing plant for bacteria. Think quality, because rubber cap seals are the furthest from it. ",4
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Mary M.,5/28/21, Love the item. Def feel more energy but it’s just so pricey. I don’t mind paying for it but wish it wasn't 9 dollars for shipping. ,3
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Gina M.,5/28/21, The flavor is not good or bad. It doesn’t have a strong flavor at all. I also like that when you get to the end it’s not like you’re drinking all the powder. ,4
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Tiffany S.,5/28/21," As much as I love athletic greens I have started shopping around for a similar product that is not so cost prohibitive. The price the greens is a lot to swallow, (pun intended) but then you add shipping and its almost $90 a month which is more than my budget allows. ",4
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Chanel M.,5/28/21, Was so excited about this—- unfortunately it’s Artificial tasting even with two big squeezes of fresh lemon.  ,1
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Anthony L.,5/28/21," I have had trouble eating greasy and fried foods in the past, and I have a noticeably easier time when I take Athletic Greens in the morning. I also use the Vitamin D drops because I live in the Pacific Northwest and am lacking the vitamins from the sun. The taste is not that bad either, I compare the taste to Flinstone chewable vitamins.  The only drawbacks for me are that the powder clouds when I pour it out of the bags into a container, and the mix tends to sink to the bottom of the bottle as I drink it, so I often have to keep adding more water (Even after I shake it).

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Beau G.,5/27/21," I like the product fine, but the shipping process has to be better. Tracking information is not up to date, orders take a long time to process. Then, you run out of something you are supposed to be taking everyday. So then you go a week with out, negating the point of taking it. ",2
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Beth A.,5/27/21, It is sweet but has a garlic aftertaste that I can't get over ,1
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Christina,5/27/21, GREAT product but TOO expensive. Intro kit WAY to fancy....don't want to be paying for that. ,4
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Emily,5/27/21," I just started my subscription and 3 days in, I feel like a totally different person. I don't think my gut health has ever been this good quite honestly. However, only downside is this is suuuper expensive greens powder for a 30 day supply. I can definitely say it's worth it, I just don't know how sustainable it is financially. I could maybe do 60/70 bucks but 100 with shipping is crazy. Shipping should be included for a subscription like this. ",4
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Kim L.,5/27/21," I've tried many green powder supplements over the years. There is without a doubt something different about Athletic Greens. I can feel the difference. I've increased my training, and I feel like I'm recovering faster. I also think my skin is looking healthier. No GI issues - in fact, this supplement seems to soothe my gut rather than agitate it. I have my partner hooked on them, and as a Licensed Acupuncturist and Integrative Medicine practitioner, I have told several of my patients about them as well. Would really like to carry them in my practice if at all possible. ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Susan J.,5/27/21, Awesomeness! ,5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Matthew K.,5/27/21, Great product but expensive ,4
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Paul L.,5/27/21," Athletic Greens is a great product, but I have concerns. It's inflated price point which approaches $1,200 CAD annually is concerning, but the vast shipping distances required to procure and distribute the product are a little tone-deaf in a world where local and climate care go hand-in-hand. I have been testing the product to see if it provides value above and beyond alternatives locally sourced, but I haven't found it as yet. It benefits from many major celebrity endorsements. I will continue testing in the interest of fairness, but I can't see an obvious benefit that makes it a stronger offering than $40 CAD/month alternatives. ",3
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Cynthia N.,5/27/21, I really like the taste and look forward to breaking my fast with the greens every day. I do think the intro kit packaging is a bit much - the fancy box and all. I just need the greens in the packet. ,5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Dani N.,5/27/21, The greens and the product is good. However I have still not received the items I was supposed to by joining. Also changing the subscription is difficult. Product is great but not the best in other aspects. ,3
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,William S.,5/27/21, Very friendly and professional. ,5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Douglas H.,5/27/21, Sweet taste but the price is very bitter. It’s able to break down when shaken so it’s not grainy when you drink it. Overall it’s decent but very expensive. ,4

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Paul K.,5/26/21, I still have not received my next package of Ultimate Daily. I was told last week that it was being shipped. I'm disappointed as I wanted to continue to use the product daily as I think it has benefits. ,2
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Jody B.,5/26/21," If the ingredients are not skewed or manipulated to sound better than they are, this is a great product.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Joseph K.,5/26/21," This is a 3.5 star review. The product itself is great. It's expensive (minus 0.5 star), but you do get what you pay for.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Ryan M.,5/25/21, Priced way too high when compared to the quantity provided for a whole month.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Anne S.,5/25/21," I only did the greens 2 days. First day I tried with water. I found the taste very unpleasant. 2nd day I tried it in my smoothie and it ruined the taste of my smoothie. I don't know how other reviews say tastes great, to me it is very unappealing.

It also does taste really good. Not a huge fan of the stevia taste but the good this product provides *far* outweighs that. I would recommend this to anyone looking to add into their diet very well-sourced and necessary nutrition. ,5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Mara R.,5/7/21," I am lactose intolerant and have struggled with gut health and acne for as long as I can remember. I bought Athletic Greens originally to fill some gaps in my diet and was very skeptical of all the benefits they promised. However - it has cleared up my acne, taken the place of my usual probiotic supplement, and overall smoothed out my gut function. I also notice that my sugar cravings are down to basically zero. I started seeing changes after maybe 5 days. ",4

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Tiffany N.,5/6/21," I have tried an insane amount of supplements, powders, mixes and juices over the past 10 years since becoming a vegetarian/vegan. I'm currently on my second month of taking Athletic Greens once a day (sometimes twice), and this is the only thing I use now. It has replaced my smoothie mix, magnesium powder, probiotic, and energy supplement! I get better results and feel better using this one product. I recently had a melanoma skin cancer removed from my leg and during surgery the doctor commented on how healthy my subcutaneous tissue was. He asked if I eat a lot of vegetables and specifically greens. I said yes I sure do! He said it has changed the color of my tissue to reflect the change, as the nutrients have been absorbed by my body. That's all I needed to hear to know this is really making a real change in my body. Thank you Athletic Greens! ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Ari S.,5/6/21," I was a bit skeptical about this product at first. I wanted a green powder that didn't taste swampy and included probiotics (this doesn't taste bad AT ALL and has a really smooth not grainy finish), this was a bit of a splurge for me but I had it 5 days a week excluding weekends so this lasted me a little over a month. I did notice a general sense of well being and my gut health DEFINITLEY improved (granted, I did reduce my coffee intake and cleaned my diet a bit). Having it first thing on an empty stomach really sets you up for a successful rest of the day because you are able to make healthier choices. But wow, I really felt the difference after I ran out. I have been without Athletic Greens for almost 3 weeks now and I can really see the difference!

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Tracey S.,4/30/21," I kept hearing about athletic greens on my favourite podcasts, and wondering if it really delivered. After doing my research and comparing the contents with other greens drinks + adaptogens, I decided to try it. First off, and everyone should know this. It's the only greens drink that actually tastes good. I've been buying greens powders for nearly 20 years and have thrown out more that I care to admit because they normally taste so terrible. Athletic greens tastes great! Even my kids (8 and 5 years old) will drink a shot just mixed with water. Next and most importantly, I feel amazing. My mood has improved substantially and this is considering that I live in Canada and am in our 3rd lockdown in a year. I also have more energy, and this has improved my home workouts. This is also the first review I've ever written for a product. It's great - worth the money. ",5

",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Ralphie I.,4/30/21, Love the product! Taste is good (given cold water and ice) and the amount needed isn't so much to intake in the morning. Only downside is having it before your morning coffee and waiting the 30 min to eat/drink afterwards. Also price. ,4
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Marcos C.,4/30/21," I have been using this product for 3 weeks now and I have definitely been feeling the difference in regards to my body responding. If I must make one negative comment is the taste while drinking it, not the best taste in the world. ",5

One thing I was disappointed with was the lack of bottle with my first subscription supply,you get one with the one off purchase so I just assumed I would get another one with a subscription but was sadly disappointed.

I am looking forward to getting it so that I don’t have to deal with the package. Currently I am traveling and I am using the individual packets which makes it really easy as I don’t have to refrigerate it. I’m really happy that I made the choice to commit to this.

Please note, they are low on welcome kits so you will not receive the whole kit when it arrives. Upon contacting CS twice, they said all we can do is wait meanwhile it feels like I waste a small amount of product at the end of the bag.

I have more sustained energy through the day, and I don't have sugar cravings in the afternoon AT ALL anymore! Also, I just had bloodwork done last week, and everything (including my thyroid) is normal! I usually have magnesium and iron showing up as low, as well as sometimes liver enzymes, cholesterol and thyroid (I am taking armour thyroid). I know that not all of this is related to Athletic Greens, but I am SURE that it is at least somewhat related! Also, I find the taste acceptable and it mixes very well. The only downside is the cost.... but I have decided that my health is worth it. If I didn't have two jobs (teacher and foodservice), I wouldn't be able to afford it, so I understand that it could be very difficult to to afford. ",5

My wife, who is 48 and has an athletic build, had been taking Nexium for heartburn every day for at least 7-8 years. After a month on Athletic Greens, we decided to try getting her off of it.

The first 3 years of my career had me down and out with colds and other sicknesses 5-8 times a school year. I started Athletic Greens 2 years ago, and I have sick about 1-2 times per year. This was all pre-covid, but Athletic Greens definitely helps me feel more able to face illness and prevent disease. When I feel a cold sneaking up, I take a double dose for a couple of days and the illness usually fades away. Love this stuff!! ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Tracy S.,4/10/21," Over the years I have tried several brands of food-sourced ""green powders"", I don't notice the difference with any of them, nothing different about Athletic Greens in that regard. I like that the product aims to ensure there is a cross section of vitamins/minerals/enzymes just in case I am not getting enough in my diet. I am not sure why the company adds stevia and why they wanted a formula that is so sweet, based on the other ingredients the sweetness was a surprise. Just because stevia is natural doesn't mean it is good for you or even neutral - adding in this type of sweetener means the company is more concerned with getting a sweet taste than your health, would be curious to try this product without the added sweetener.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Meagan,4/10/21," This has been such a lifesaver for my husband and I! We work hard to provide balanced diets and clean supplements for our daughters but were not taking great care of ourselves. After several months of terrible breakouts on my face and low, low energy in the afternoons/evenings, I knew that I needed to make a change. Since taking Athletic Greens, my skin is clearer, my gut health has improved, and the greens definitely gives me a zip of energy either as a coffee replacement in the morning or an afternoon pick me up on a rough day. And I actually really like the taste, especially when mixed with cold water right out of the fridge. This product is a little bit of a splurge for our family's budget so my husband and I share a bag and obviously do not take it every day. But a few times a week, I look forward to my Athletic Greens! (And for those questioning the price of this product, it would cost a small fortune to purchase EACH of the different supplements included in this powder INDIVIDUALLY! So to my husband and I, it is worth the price tag!) ",5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Chad N.,4/9/21, I had an amazing multi-vitamin (formulated for am and pm) I was a big fan of. Once I learned about Athletic Greens and how the founder could have sold out to a large corp. and didn't because they would have changed the raw ingredients for better margins I made the switch. I love this product and hope they never sell out. It may not provide all the levels of supplement I was receiving from my multiple-vitamin but I feel taking AG in liquid form on an empty stomach helps my body absorb the vitamins and not purge valuable ingredients. Not to mention the additional benefit of the enzymes and probiotics not found in your traditional multi-vitamin. It is absolutely worth the price. My wife take this and are trying to figure out a way to budget it for our kids. ,5

As a Father of young twin girls, a 'serious' amateur marathon runner with a demanding job within the Oil and Gas sector I was very dubious to try this product but new I needed to try something to fill holes in my flagging energy levels and diet. After 2 weeks of taking this product I noticed I can last longer into the evening, get to sleep with no issue (and stay asleep) and feel I have much more energy to spend with my kids when they need me most. Anyone who has trained properly for a marathon whether you are a 6 hour marathoner or an elite, knows how much energy this one sport takes from you.

I have turned a lot of my friends on to it, challenging them to try it for 30 days. After a month, they tell me how great they feel. Stop sitting on the fence and sign-up! ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Kelly E.,3/28/21," I’ve only been on the greens a month but I loved it! The only problem is I signed up for a recurring shipment and I’ve been without the greens for a week tomorrow. I really wanted to see what the effects would be if taken daily, but it seems there’s an issue with recurring shipments arriving on time. Might check to see if they offer just buying a few bags at a time and storing up. ",4
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Grace L.,3/28/21," This is the best green drink I have ever tasted. I wanted the benefits of greens but just couldn't stomach them. Tim Ferris, an 'influencer' promoted these and I believed that he had done his homework -so I gave them a try. I actually look forward to starting my day with them! Previously, when I had greens, my stomach turned at the thought of them and I literally held my nose to get through them, only finishing them due to the expense and not wanting to waste them. As for what Athletic Greens cost, considering that I am not paying for other vitamin supplements, and I WANT to take it, it is well worth the value. Another boon for me is that didn't want to rely so much on coffee picking me up in the mornings, and this stuff gives me a great, but gentle, lift and buzz! Highly recommend! ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Lindsay T.,3/28/21," I feel refuelled when I drink my dose of Althetic Greens! Bam, I’m back to optimal levels of activity again!!  ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Sandy S.,3/28/21," I would give this 4 1/2 stars only because the flavor took a little getting used to. After using it a month, I have gotten used to it. I used this product for 1 month and then stopped for a month. I noticed the difference. AG helped with energy, bloating, recovery from workouts, and improved sleep. I prefer taking a multivitamin in a drink form because I use other ""pill"" form supplements. I definitely recommend AG. ",4
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Kimberly P.,3/28/21," I am enjoying athletic greens as a morning beverage knowing it's loaded with good vitamins and minerals for me.

They apologized for the delay and sent a new shipment expedited for me and refunded the shipping cost! I was not expecting this at all! ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,William T.,3/28/21," I have been an Athletic Greens customer since the middle of 2020, and I have found it to be a great tasting and easy to use product that has taken the place of traditional pill supplements in my diet while proving to be overall better for my diet. At first, I was skeptical of it given my past experiences with green supplements and drinks that tend to taste horrible and leave an aftertaste thats worse then eating chalk, but athletic greens is different. It mixes well, tastes great, and the container and scoop that they send you really helps with keeping it fresh in the fridge. I also subscribe and get the vanilla protein powder, which has little sugar but still tastes better then some brands that are loaded with sugar. I tend to mix the green supplement with the protein powder in the morning and I find the combination is a great way to start the day. My only criticism is that the amount that they send in the green packet rarely lasts all month even with careful even spoon fulls and management, and the portion powder only lasts about 18 days, so I have found myself having to order extra canisters of the protein powder and the greens shake to fully make it last a month between subscription shipments. Overall, a great product that I would highly recommend, just be sure to watch how much your using if you want to make it last to the next shipment. ",5

And the great thing about it is, it tastes just fine, I enjoy it. Every morning when I wake up, I drink my athletic green, then a half an hour later I start my day with coffee breakfast and work, or play, just like when I forgot to take my athletic green omega-3 fish oil, I don't feel like I have the same pep when I don't take my athletic greens.

The shipping however is super slow. I understand that all shipments are slower these days, but the shipping speed is the slowest of any product I have ordered. If you order, allow at least 2 weeks before you get the product. You will also not get any estimated delivery date beside the information saying arriving on time...and then poof...arriving late. With no estimated date. So if you are on subscription service you will need to budget (use less than a full scoop) to allow for the delay in delivery. ",4

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Jackie R.,3/10/21, I didn’t notice night/day difference. Probably because we replaced a crap ton of vitamins with Athletic greens so we were already on the road to recovery. I do believe vitamin D is playing a major role in my mood. I usually suffer from depression and being extremely unmotivated. HOWEVER READ THE LABEL CAREFULLY. PEOPLE GET THE DOSE CONFUSED ALOT. YOU CAN OD ON VIT D. HAVE YOUR DR DRAW LABS AND TELL YOU HOW MANY DROPS TO TAKE. Tastes like pineapple. The last drink is very gritty as all the residual sifts to the bottom. I just rinse the cup and swallow it down. Overall it brings comfort knowing I’m putting good into my body. I would like to see Athletic Greens start putting the percent of daily value for each nutrient. Ya we are getting 75+ nutrients but how do we even know it’s beneficial if it’s not labeled with how much we are getting? People just look at the label and think it’s amazing to have that many varieties of nutrients but too nieve to think it’s probably not enough to make a difference. ,4

It's now my morning ritual. ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Diane H.,3/8/21," Have been using this product since November 2020. Has definitely improved my energy and well being, so much so that if I don't drink it for a couple days I notice a huge difference in energy. I have tried other green drinks and this one is definitely the best tasting one. Initially it was an acquired taste but now I look forward to drinking it. I would give this a five star plus if they did not contain the Stevia as I find it leaves a slightly weird taste, more so in the Protein Powder. Because of that I would not buy the protein powder again as I find it too sweet with an unpleasant aftertaste. I think the greens would be even more exceptional without Stevia. I offered a sample of the greens to a friend of mine, who because of the Stevia developed a headache after drinking it. I was hoping she would benefit from them as much as I have. Just my two cents.

I noticed a boost in energy and just general sense of starting my day off right ever since I started drinking it every morning. My only complaint is the bottom of the package makes the last few scoops very difficult to get out, leading to some struggling and wasted product which is not ideal given how expensive it is. ",4
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Gillon M.,3/7/21, Shipping is slow and they’re a little expensive in comparison to others on the market. Tastes okay. Nothing you’ll look forward to but it wont keep you away either. Remains to be seen over time what health benefit there might be. ,3
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Sarah P.,3/7/21," The flavor is really good, kind of pineapple coconut.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Chad G.,3/6/21," I began using Athletic Greens nearly 3 years ago . I haven't kept a continual use which has actually helped me realize the true effectiveness of the product. ncluded driving through the contiguous 48 states, i realized I needed to change something so that I would be more mentally aware and less fatigued. Along with an Intermittent Fast Diet I introduced Athletic Greens into my daily diet. Results for me were nearly immediate. After the first week I noticed a shift in mentality and more regular energy. My mind seemed sharper and more focused. Having the greens first thing in the morning also cut out cravings which was a huge benefit to the diet and within a month I had dropped a significant amount of weight! ",5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Malia T.,3/6/21," So my husband and I finally decided to try Athletic Greens after hearing about it advertised by different podcasters for a few years now. We always try to get enough greens and vegetables in our diet but never eat quite as many as we mean to. So here’s how it went for us. Just a couple days after starting it, we immediately noticed an increase in energy. Then only a few days later we noticed improved digestion. It’s been just over a month and we feel so much better than before!! The energy levels have stayed up, we don’t have nearly as many stomach issues as we used to, and for the first time in my life I have nice fingernails. They used to always break off and chip if I ever tried to grow them even a millimeter past my fingertips but now they feel much stronger and more durable than before. My mom actually said it looks like I got a French manicure but of course I didn’t. My hair is also getting smoother and easier to manage, which seems kind of impossible after just a month, but I’m happy to say it’s true. The greens don’t taste as great as orange juice or something, but considering everything that’s in the greens powder, it tastes as good as you could hope. Absolutely loving the greens and though it’s kind of expensive you couldn’t get me to stop taking it because it has really changed my life. ",5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Shagah Z.,3/5/21," I have been using athletic greens daily for about a month and have enjoyed the product. I definitely see a change in my skin, energy and GI.

And for some reason, I don't ""crave"" suspect foods now. Great stuff. The shipping, though, is tough to deal with.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Olivia L.,3/5/21, I wish the powder would dissolve better into the water. It’s gritty which is tough for me to get down. I’m also not a fan of the taste. I’ve not had other greens powders so I have nothing to compare it to. I can usually choke it down because the nutrients are awesome and I like how pure the ingredients are. Also appreciate how transparent they are about their supply chain. ,3

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Shawn G.,3/4/21, Athletic Greens have been a daily morning routine for the past 2 years. The benefits are tangible in that I have not been sick with a virus since starting taking 'greens' first thing in the morning - well before any coffee or breakfast to let the prebiotics work. I also add D3 and believe this assists in the results that I have experienced. Other members of my family now green up and deplete my supply meaning I have to advance my autoship dates all the time ! ,5

Ran out 2 days before the monthly result came (very common problem on the Facebook page, the art probably needs to be increased slightly). Welcome pack with shaker and storage jar was a very nice touch - kudos! After all that, I love being on this mix, I feel great, and no more coffee cravings.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Owen C.,3/3/21," I was recommended to try athletic greens by a friend of mine and I'm 90% very happy with it. My first very small issue is that there is just a little bit of grittiness if I don't stir it enough at the start. The second is that, because it uses so many greens, there is a slight bitterness (that I solve with a sugar-free flavoring/sweetener). The third, more substantial issue, is that the ceramic container that comes with is very heavy and completely smooth, and every time I take it out of the fridge I'm worried that I'll drop it and it will shatter. Other than those things, I'm very happy with the product! ",4
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Peter C.,3/3/21, I took Athletic Greens every morning for 8 weeks and did not notice any differences.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Clinton B.,3/1/21," I love the supplement. It feels great taking it. However, for how expensive it is, it’d be nice if the monthly subscription bags were a little less stingy. I even off the top of the scoop, with no extra, every day, and I still have to go 2-3 days without it at the end of every month.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Randall E.,2/27/21," Just received my 3rd month’s pouch of AG. At 68, I am probably not the typical AG subscriber. And though I have never lacked energy, am in relatively good physical shape and get plenty of regular exercise, I continue to feel good & strong, and know that I am getting a group of vitamins and minerals without taking a handful of pills. I have to believe that body absorption of the vitamins is more efficient when taken in this fashion. Although, I am perplexed why AG put additional D3 and K2 in a liquid supplement bottle. Maybe it’s a science or pharmacology answer. I had a couple of start-up issues with receipt of product and promo items, however the AG customer support reps whom I chatted with were incredibly helpful, knowledgable and followed through on promises. I could not have asked for more. ",5

Unfortunately, there’s too much skepticism about the positive effects of supplementation but I’m convinced that anyone who takes athletic greens for a week will notice a difference in how they feel on a daily basis and that should be enough to convince anyone of its efficacy.

After a month, I decided it was fine but I wasn't willing to pay that much each month for something that I could probably get somewhere else for cheaper. I cancelled my subscription and didn't think about it again until 2 days later. I felt horrible. I felt tired and just plan blah. I went over the past few days in my mind and realized that the only thing I had changed was that I had stopped taking Athletic Greens. I immediately got back online and started my subscription again. After telling my husband about my experience, he decided to give it a try too. We love it. It isn't cheap each month but it is definitely worth it. We just look at it like a meal replacement.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Laura S.,1/15/21," I like the idea of getting so many needed vitamins and minerals first thing in the am. I often don't get enough greens throughout the day through my regular nutrition. I don't typically drink my greens before I work out except for Saturdays before my personal training session. Maybe it's all in my head but I feel like I have a little more energy if I drink my greens versus if I don't. As many have said in reviews I've read, the taste is an acquired one. It has a flavor that reminds me of bubble gum but an earthy bubble gum. As long as my water is extremely cold, the taste does not bother me. The one thing that keeps Athletic Greens from being excellent is that they don't fully dissolve. No matter how much water I use, how much I shake it up, or how long I let the greens sit and then re-shake them, there's always a fair amount of grit at the bottom. I have to clench my teeth and use them as a strainer and then chew up the grit. Otherwise, it causes me to cough and sometimes gag. ",4

At first I was skeptical about it but I am sure that it has helped my overall health. I don't have any to show improvement, but I like my energy levels and my blood pressure has gone down a little bit.   about the product, the only thing I would say is that since the product itself is a little bit on the high end as far as price, you should consider absorbing the shipping charges in order to make it more affordable for people. I order a lot of things online and most companies include free shipping when you spend more than 75 dollars (regardless of the weight). To be honest, I am considering looking for other alternatives because of this. I am sure i am probably not the only one who is a bit tight financially, and can share the same feelings. Anyways, i hope this helps... ",4
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Donna V.,1/2/21," I feel so much better after taking Athletic Greens for 30 days. I can’t imagine going back to not having it. I feel more focused, energetic, and balanced. I have fewer cravings for unhealthy food as well. Go Athletic Greens! ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,David S.,1/2/21," Starting around October 2019 to this review today on January 1, 2021, I believe I have the experience to write an honest review of my opinion of Athletic Greens. Prior to my subscription I was what one might refer to as a ""Cold Magnet"". I'd average four to six Colds per year, each one lasting around four weeks with ten to twelve symptoms from sore throat to sinus triggers to lack of energy to stuffed up and of course miserable each time. I'd supplemented with D3 to some help, but everything else I'd tried over some 30 years was essentially worthless and a waste of hard earned money. I began consuming Athletic Greens about 14 months ago and while I do believe I've contracted Viruses during these last 14 months, I have exhibited almost no cold symptoms. Keep in mind that a large portion of this time frame happened during the Pandemic, in New York City (Manhattan), and as an ""Essential Worker"" I spent five days each week walking to and from work, and interacting with a great many people. I believe without a shadow of a doubt that Athletic Greens daily consumption has kept me healthy and feeling good. I currently have a 15 Day subscription and I do not like to live without it. ",5

After the first few days I started noticing I was drinking less coffee and didn't get tired around 2pm (which always seemed normal) I found myself having energy without jitters or anxiety and helping me into a good morning routine. I would say though (maybe I'm not mixing it enough or something) but there's often powder that doesn't mix all the way through so finishing the drink isn't always fun and it takes a couple shakes to make those last few sips but other than that I love this product and will definitely buy another bag once I have the funds to do so! ,4

On the negative side, whereas I thought that my metabolism might speed up and enable weight loss, I have been gaining weight steadily.

Let’s face it, it’s pricey compared to others. But man is it worth it. I’ve been drinking Athletic Greens every morning for just over a month now and I have noticed a change in my digestion/gut health (especially with bloating after meals), I have more energy throughout the day, and my skin is glowing.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Stephanie H.,12/15/20," I started taking Athletic Greens on a daily basis about two months ago per the suggestion of a friend whose been a customer for almost a year. I live in the PacNW and SAD (seasonal affect disorder) is a thing that I've battled with every year. I had expected that this year would have been especially tough due to the pandemic and not being able to travel, etc. Fast forward to now, December, the height of rain and grey skies, and I'm not feeling the 'blah' as much as I had thought I would. I truly believe this product (which has the B vitamins) is helping to keep the winter blues at bay. (Note: I do add a liquid Vitamin D to my drink). I have my drink every day on an empty stomach, after a morning walk and I'm finding I actually look forward to getting home to it! The flavor is good, and the feeling I get from it is a clean, clear energy. I like knowing that I'm getting all of the vitamins I need without having to swallow a handful of pills, juggle how many and when I can take said handful of pills and then have the gross vitamin flavored burps for a few hours. I think I'm going to splash out and get some for my family for Xmas! ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Matthew G.,12/15/20," After 1 month of AG I do feel that I am more alert and I believe it has helped build my immune system. I say this because my entire household other than me caught a cold 2 weeks after I started AG and I was the only one not to get it, I am also the only one taking AG. Spending the money I do on AG is also encouraging me to make other healthy choice, for example, ""if I am spending all that money on AG then I am not going to eat a donut for breakfast"". It has also helped me start my day off by hydrating immediately which is something I wasn't great a prior to taking AG. ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Sireena F.,12/15/20," Athletic Greens is the best multivitamin I’ve ever had. It’s easily absorbed and has a pleasant taste. No huge pill like grocery store multivitamins; and you don’t have to take a handful of horse sized pills like with GNC multivitamin packets. AND no nasty burps like I would get with every other multivitamin. No burps at all because it’s easily digested and absorbed. Athletic Greens really are the best multivitamin out there, and I’ve tried A LOT in my 54 years. It’s worth the extra money. The proof is in your pee. You don’t get that bright yellow, almost neon yellow, like you do when you take the pill form multivitamins. And that’s because your body is absorbing so much more with Athletic Greens. ",5

Using Athletic Greens daily has helped me with reducing (and typically, removing) these symptoms completely; while I don't think Athletic Greens is the sole reason for this, adding it to a routine rich in collagen smoothies, reduced carb intake and a more active lifestyle have all been integral to the improvement.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Vanessa D.,11/20/20," I’ve been taking athletic greens for a month now and these are the things I noticed. When I take AG on an empty stomach, it kinda makes my stomach feel a little unsettled but it only lasts for a few minutes. It could also be because I drink it like a shot of tequila because I don’t enjoy the taste too much but I did notice that my waist line was looking smaller or maybe the right word is deflated since I started taking AG. I would assume it has something to do with the gut bacteria. The taste was difficult to get past at first but I somehow felt like I recognized the taste and then I suddenly I realized it tastes exactly like a marijuana edible, the green flavor, and after I realized that the taste always gives me a big smile hah. That is all that I have actually noticed or attributed directly towards taking the all in one supplement but in my mind it’s one of those things that you see over a long period of time by giving your body the nutrients it needs everyday to maintain a healthy body. I will continue to take AG as long as I can afford to or until I figure out how to get all of the nutrients I need from diet alone. ",5

The only thing we didn’t like was that it comes in a bag, as the lower it gets, the harder it is to scoop from the bag. This month we were finally going to invest in a new storage option. But to our surprise we were gifted with a storage container in this month’s shipment. We were so thrilled and thankful, since we had just been talking about it.

Athletic Greens helps you to start your day with a win: it's easy to do and it makes you feel great. I don't have to worry about keeping stocks of certain foods because I can count on so many vitamins and minerals in the powder. It's one less thing I have to concern myself with, it's a fantastic value to anyone worried about their daily nutrition, and the company clearly places a high value on its customer relationships. I'm really looking forward to using the travel packs since I'm notoriously negligent with nutrition when I'm on the road. I can already tell this will help. Highly recommend! ",5

I've noticed some positive effects and I'm encouraged as I continue to use it for the next several months. It mixes easily and The Taste is ok. I greatly appreciated the container and mixing bottle with my second shipment! ,4
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Casey P.,10/21/20," I was skeptical about Athletic Greens initially but figured I would give it a try. I knew that I didn't cover all of the bases with my diet and needed something extra to fill the gaps. Within the first two weeks I noticed huge improvements with energy and digestion. Still skeptical if they were worth the price, I tried a competitor off of amazon. Huge difference. I realized that I was actually paying for quality and results which ultimately led to me becoming a subscription customer. I highly recommend! ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Donald F.,10/21/20," I have used premium flash - freeze dried greens since 2000. This is now a very competitive field. From my research A.G's are a good quality product. I like it that they set up a shipping schedule and you can alert it on-line. Like any premium product, it is not inexpensive. ",4

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Donald G.,10/21/20, I really liked the product. I signed up for the subscription monthly. I was disappointed to have run out before my next shipment arrived. I didn’t miss a single day of the first supply. It basically replaced coffee for me in the morning. ,4
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Kaled R.,10/21/20," I've never been to one to eat veggies, and even though I try, I don't really do a decent job. Athletic Greens helps in getting the needed daily nutrition and provides great fuel for your workouts! ",5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Britt T.,10/21/20," Awesome product. I run a company in a high-pressure environment and prior to taking AG, would often experience symptoms of anxiety ( like waking up with a racing heart). The biggest difference I’ve noticed, personally, since taking Athletic Greens is those “symptoms” have reduced greatly. e Customer Service team!  ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Barbara B.,10/21/20, I have yet to find another greens drink that I actually want to drink. The amount of ingredients is insane and yet it mixes right into water. I can definitely tell a difference as can my fiance when adding this to our lives. ,5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Tyler F.,10/21/20," Great product, fantastic company, amazing ingredients. Only issue is the mix makes me very nauseous. I’m the only one I’ve heard of who has this, allowing me to speculate that either my body needs to adjust (i only take ½ scoop now), or I’m slightly allergic to one of the ingredients. All in all, highly recommend- i doubt if you’d have my same challenges. ",4
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Katrina G.,10/21/20," So far I am enjoying my Athletic Greens. It is a little pricey. Im not sure that I feel all that different but I trust that it is helping me get the nutrients I need for the day. I may feel a tiny bit more energized, so I have been omitting coffee every other day or so. Also the mixture really needs to be cold cold for me, if my jug runs out of ice I have to refill it or else I really cant drink it. That makes it challenging when Im out and about but when Im home its no problem! So far I am very happy! ",5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Millet S.,10/20/20, The product creates an interesting challenge to our mornings due to the empty stomach followed by 30 minutes of not eating. Although we are both retired we find our slow morning start a real time constraint. I am nearing 87 and find that I do not have the additional energy I had hoped AG would assist with. Possibly I am  much.  ,4

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Annette S.,10/18/20," I really like the Athletic Greens. They are easy to mix in water, tasty and good for you. My only complaint is the cost. Once you add in shipping and tax, they end up costing $90.00/month. If they could replace my multivitamin then it would work, but the greens are missing some nutrients that a multivitamin would have so both are needed. I have found other greens that are also really nice, but about $30 less per month. ",4

I have been using it daily usually mixed with either almond milk or if not available in the refrig sometimes 2%. I don’t think I have very large hands but the pouch is difficult to use as it is so narrow. If it was just an inch shorter and an inch wider it would be perfect. ,5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Tiff C.,10/12/20," I try to eat healthy, but I know I’m probably not getting everything my body needs to perform at its best. I started taking Athletic Greens to fill in that gap. I didn’t notice things right away, but after a couple of weeks, I noticed more clarity of mind and a seemingly endless well of energy. No more afternoon dips. I didn’t talk myself out of doing chores or workouts after work. I even gave up caffeine (still searching for a good decaf bean, though) because I didn’t need that morning jolt. And I’m an inveterate coffee snob. What a great product! So you can imagine my disappointment when I got home from a work trip and my order wasn’t there even though I was notified that it had been delivered. I certainly didn’t blame AG for the missing product, but I knew they would probably more sympathetic than the shipping company. I explained my situation to Kristel the chat agent, and she had a new shipment sent out right away. It was a very pleasant and professional interaction, and they took it upon themselves to correct a wrong that they were probably not responsible for. I tell everyone who is looking for a change for the better about AG, but now I have even more reason to be enthusiastic about this product and the company itself. Cheers! ",5

So I bought a new blender and found a smoothie recipe I like and within 2 weeks of being back on my Athletic Greens I have energy, my digestion issues are GREATLY improved and I've gotten compliments about my skin being more hydrated. This stuff is a total gamechanger and I'm a customer for life! ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Kera H.,10/11/20, I work in big 4 consulting and if you know anything about that industry it is that we drink caffeine non stop.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Mary P.,9/27/20," honestly, i was not expecting a lot when i ordered AG. But i thought that i would give it a shot, after hearing a couple of podcast hosts (whom i like and respect) talking in glowing terms about AG. Also, i try to support sponsors of my favorite podcasts, so I decided, at worst, there would be no effect, or i could just stop taking it and at least i would be helping out the podcast by supporting their sponsor. I was delighted when AG seemed to improve flexibility and inflammation. I run every day (20+ miles/week) and do yoga almost daily; i have a torn meniscus which flares up somedays and messes with my running routine. Since i started AG about 6 weeks ago, i have noticed improvement in yoga, running, and knee flare-ups. I don't think that it is a placebo effect, because I was not expecting ANYTHING to happen. so i was pleasantly surprised to have noticeable improvement that started almost immediately and continues through today. I recommend AG to everyone. It is pricey, but if you can afford it, it is worth it. I actually cancelled another monthly subscription membership that i had to move the expenditure to AG. ",5

The biggest benefit I’ve seen has been with elimination, which has improved greatly. At first I was having shake every day mixed with nut milk rather than water and with some kind of fruit and extra protein. They are delicious. However, I’ve now cut down to having one three or four times a week instead because of the cost. It is very expensive. Hopefully I’ll see more benefits in the coming months. ",4

I work in a titanium mill working 12 hour shifts rotating shifts between days and nights often so naturally caffeine has been my best friend. After using this product I experienced higher levels of energy, improved gut health, and interestingly enough this resulted in me giving up coffee almost completely with little to no caffeine withdrawal symptoms. The main downside is the taste though which I could handle on a daily basis at first but quickly grew tired of.

Despite being displayed in multiple promotional images. However, when my package arrived it was just the greens. I was sorely disappointed that for such an intensely high price tag, the company made no effort to include customer appreciation, incentive or promotional/marketing materials. Not even a plastic scoop. And I purchased a subscription not a one-time purchase. I often purchase from small, local, new or start up companies and the smallest gesture goes a long way.  ",4

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Phillip O.,9/17/20," I got this for my lady and I after hearing about it on JRE. We usually eat a decent amount of vegetables and greens, but there are times when kale and broccoli just don't sound as good with my lunch. So I figured these would be a good way to make sure we're getting our stuff. The first thing I noticed was that the taste is surprisingly good. Then after a week or so, I started to notice that when I drink it in the morning on an empty stomach, I'm more motivated to get a workout in. I also feel like I focus better on my work. That stuff could be complete placebo, but I do think there's something to it. The only thing I wish is that it were less expensive. Otherwise, I love this stuff. ",5

Only downside I've found is that, no matter how much you shake it up, theres always a bit at the bottom of the cup that's very gritty and hard to finish. Doesn't matter how well you shake it, by hand or with a blender. So I always end up getting to the last tiny bit, then refilling the cup halfway and shaking it back up. Not terrible since this is a god excuse to drink more water, but a bit annoying. ",4
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Patrick P.,9/16/20," Love the product, it may be more expensive than other greens products out there, but it is worth it's weight ",5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,lena,9/15/20," Ive used many supplements over the years not necessarily for weight-loss but more to optimize my health, many brands are missing key ingredients or have extra sugars or fillers. I couldn't be happier I found Athletic Greens! So far the biggest difference i can see is my greys aren't coming in as fast as they were in between my hair appointments. So its got to being working wonders on the parts I can't see. ",5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Mikhail B.,9/15/20," I’m a disabled navy veteran. For the last two and a half years I’ve been going through a nightmare scenario where I’ve had to relearn how to walk. Before I started athletic greens I wasn’t really taking any supplements. But I was taking a bunch of medication. And I had major brain fog. I was exercising every day but not seeing results. And I didn’t know it, but I just didn’t look healthy. I started taking athletic greens about 3 months ago. After a few days I noticed I could focus again. The brain fog went away. After a few weeks I started looking better. And it was weird hearing it because it’s not something you notice it’s something others notice about you. I got a personal trainer and my work outs are intense. I’m not an athlete by far. I’m just a guy trying to recover from a really bad injury. But man is my trainer surprised at how quickly I bounce back. At how ready I am to move on to the next work out and I’ve personally seen the results not only in myself. But my 75 year old father who I got a subscription for as well. I went from barely being able to walk 10 minutes at 1.7mph to 50 minutes at 3mph. My dad who I had tried to get on supplements and would never take them actually started taking one. I thought I lost him to brain fog. I thought I lost him to old age and that there was no hope. In the last couple of months I’ve seen my 75 year old dad get his personality back. I’ve seen him go from barely being able to walk 9 minutes on the treadmill to 27 minutes with a 20 degree incline. I don’t know what you guys put in this stuff. But it’s magic to me. And at this point it’s crucial. For my recovery. And for my aging father. I can’t thank you guys enough for this awesome product. I’m 34 years old. I spent these last 2.5 years isolated in my room. And I’m finally starting to get my life back. And I don’t think it’s just a coincidence that my recovery has accelerated over the last 3 months like this. I don’t think I could’ve gotten this far if I didn’t take the chance. Thank you all for the great product. And cheers to your company for making something truly awesome. ",5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Marie H.,9/10/20," Normally I wouldn't order something like this online, but my neighbor (who eats very healthy) told me about this. My first question was, ""How does it taste?"" He said it tasted very good, but I was not quite convinced - he thinks EVERYTHING tastes good! I'm a fussy eater, having grown up in the 50's when all I ate was sugared cereal in the morning, peanut butter sandwich for lunch, and meat and potatoes for supper. I recently became disgusted with my weight and I have totally changed my eating habits, and lost 24 lbs. So I took a chance and ordered Athletic Greens. I take it first thing in the morning on an empty stomach, as recommended. IT TASTES GOOD! I believe it's the pineapple that gives it that very pleasant taste. As a bonus, I HAVE ENERGY! I'm almost 69 years old and I have arthritis in almost every joint, along with fibromyalgia (which causes pain in the muscles and tendons). On top of this I have MS (multiple sclerosis) which has limited my mobility (I can only walk with a walker) and all 3 of these conditions cause FATIGUE. The Athletic Greens has given me energy! I ride 2 miles on my stationary bike as much as I can, and I have been motivated to clean out some closets and deep clean my kitchen cabinets. I haven't done this in years! If you're wondering whether you should try this or just pass up this deal, I would highly recommend it! ",5

Researching supplement to help aid his transition he found Athletic Greens to be the best way to get as much nutrients as possible. Using AG daily in the morning he has completely transformed his health longterm. Loosing weight, gaining energy and improving his health and attitude overall.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Jey,9/10/20," Hi all, I have taken Essential 1 from Procaps Laboratories for years and was curious to see how it compared to Athletic Greens when I heard about it on the POMP Podcast. When I reviewed the ingredients list and the nutrition label, I was surprised that the 1 capsule I've been taking daily has pretty much everything AG has, plus it beats AG in many categories by a long shot. One bottle gives you 365 days of nutition for $120 or $9/mo. It also has not taste because it's a capsule with zero additives, egg or milk! My honest review from looking at the comparison is that unless you absolutely just love the taste of the drink, it makes no sense to spend $55/mo or $660/year for basically the same level of nutrition. Just saying... ",5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Gina A.,9/1/20," Initially Athletic Greens caused a bit of constipation and a little shakiness, as if it includes caffeine. There seems to be days where my workouts are better as a result of AG, maybe that’s what I tell myself at least, but I do believe it has helped. It is quite an investment and I’m trying to decide if I will continue to invest in the same way. I may need more time using AG before making a final decision. ",4

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Heidi H.,9/1/20," It was when I discontinued taking the product that I realized how much better I feel when I am using it. Better energy (I don't do caffeine.) So I'm back on it and much to my surprise, after consistent use, I also see that my finger nails are no longer shredding/peeling and my skin overall looks better. Of course, I'm exercising and trying to eat well. Also, using the Vitamin D3 drops w/ K2 and like to think that's boosting my immune system. Does not give me reflux like so many other multivitamin supplements. Thankful for that because have discontinued other supplements due to nasty reflux and vitamin smell. Have recommended this to others and since learned that many women I know (from the gym) are also using this. Shout out to Dr. Rangan Chatterjee, Live Better Feel More podcast, for bringing this excellent product to my attention. ",5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Brad P.,8/31/20," This is month 6 of using AG on a daily basis. I'm 51 and in really good shape but my eating habits leave a lot to be desired. It's the first thing I want in the morning and occasionally drink a second round of AG if I put in a second workout. It's gotten to the point that if I am traveling on business and leave at home, I have my wife overnight it to my hotel. Taste is good and I have found that the colder the water is, the better it is.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Ashley P.,8/26/20," I've been using Athletic Greens for a couple of months now - I added it to my health routine as I've been working on losing 50 pounds since January, started at 175 and am just about there at 128. I already eat very healthfully as a vegetarian and maintaining a diet of 1200 calories per day focused on nutrient-dense foods as part of my health plan, but this has given me a noticable boost - I have more energy and don't tire as easily from some tough workouts. I was starting to drag a bit but since adding Athletic Greens, I don't even consider skipping a workout. It fits easily into my calorie budget at 40 calories a serving, and I often mix it with some protein powder - it oddly goes well with chocolate! My only complaint is that I didn't notice the instructions to keep it in the fridge at first, so make sure you do after to open it. ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Alicia G.,8/26/20," From a nutrition perspective, this is a pretty well rounded greens powder, though a little lacking on the minerals front.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Jesse H.,8/20/20," I have a suggestion. The scoop that comes in every pouch should be different. It should be longer because I can't imagine anyone with bigger hands than myself reaching into the bag and doing it without making a mess. I have medium hands and I get powder all over myself when I scoop. Secondly, what if the scoop only came with a customer's first order. And the scoop was designed to be more robust, reusable? Reaching into the bag with the small scoop is frustrating. Make a better scoop that people can reuse for other purposes and then you won't have to include one in every single pouch....AND you will avoid contributing to single-use waste. Anyone ordering the powder could check a box if they require a new scoop. Otherwise, they get one scoop for life and you cut your overhead down. it's worth considering. ",4

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Jodi S.,8/1/20," I've been taking supplements for years, and I had never made the jump to Athletic Greens because of the price point.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Michael P.,7/31/20," I believe the advertising, I hope Athletic Greens is truly working. I can't say I've noticed a tremendous physical difference but the belief that I'm getting all my greens in one serving is at least making me feel more confident about my diet. I believe the price of Athletic Greens is a bit high from the impact I'm feeling but I'm willing to give it some time, eventually go without it and see if I notice a difference. ",3

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Allen O.,7/31/20, Love starting my day with my greens. It’s the first thing I drink in the morning. The pre and probiotics help with my GI system and the digestive enzymes help with food processing. ,5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Stana O.,7/30/20," Not only is this a great way to get in some crucial micronutrients before the chickens are up, it also was super easy on my digestive system, gives me a nice boost of energy in the morning (which has replaced my 3 cups of coffee cracked out shakes!), and to be honest, my mental clarity and groggy feeling that I had due to my terrible sleep issues have improved greatly. Price-wise... yes, it is more expensive than some other brands BUT you get what you pay for. Taste-wise, the licorice extract can be a bit of a forward palate but it has a refreshing finish. I recommend the subscription but also getting some travel packs for those days on the move .. even in a pandemic, up and out early is a huge investment in mental and physical health so those packets save time (a big win!) and less stress when you want to make the most of your mornings. As a lifelong competitive athlete (soccer turned CF turned boxing & lifting) with sleep issues, recovery is crucial and this has been a game changer. ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Jack S.,7/30/20, Great product. Pretty sure it's working but I couldn't point out any remarkable differences than before. Maybe improved mood in the mornings. Drawback is the price. Hard to determine whether it's really worth it. ,4
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Caroline R.,7/30/20," The flavor took 1/2 bag to get used to, but I'm one of those weird people that likes earthy grasses flavors no one else likes. But now I love the taste. It also helps with elimination very quickly which is ALWAYS a good thing. ",5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Danielle L.,7/30/20," I was excited to try Athletic Greens for the first time, but I was extremely disappointed. Typically the thought of having spent money on something (in this case $80) is enough for me to use it no matter what, but this stuff just tastes too terrible. Wanted to like it but sadly I can't recommend it to anyone. ",2
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Glen S.,7/30/20," Being in Canada, I am debating stopping this purely on the price. Other products out there give a high percentage of what Athletic Greens gives for 10-20 dollars lower, if not more. Besides that, I do like the product. ",4
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Stacy N.,7/30/20," I really love your product and your customer service is outstanding. I had an issue with the timing of my order and I was really impressed with the company's personal feeling response. I have referred many people due to the quality of the products and their service.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Trisha R.,7/30/20," I cannot tell a lie: it took a minute to enjoy my Greens. I'm used to eating a lot of vegetables and green juices and whatnot, but AG was an entirely new flavor, texture and experience. Once I figured out the best way to take them (mixed in a glass of very cold coconut water), the day got much easier for me! I have it first thing, before coffee and breakfast, and it does help to wake me up and get my day going. I've felt more energetic and after being sick from basically December through February (not COVID, but every other respiratory infection), haven't even had a sniffle ... and I've got bad seasonal allergies. It's only been 2 months since I started taking my AG, so I'm looking forward to even more improvements. I lead a pretty healthy lifestyle, but was at a low point after all the illness and then going into lockdown shortly after finally feeling better, and AG helped kickstart an overhaul of my eating and workouts. Sometimes you just need that one small step! ",5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,David F.,7/29/20," I do a 16-8 fast most days so I don't eat breakfast - but I don't want to skip out on nutrition. I tried Athletic Greens for the first time just about a month ago. It's been a great way to kick start my day with lots of nutrition but almost no calories. I just mix it with water and ice and add a few dashes of turmeric (which I find improves the flavor for me a bit). I think it would work great with almond milk, oat milk or in a shake on mornings where I need more calories to fuel a long run (or because I'm giving in to hunger) so I'm looking forward to trying that.

The benefits of green drinks is appearing more and more to be a key to longevity, muscle and brain growth and athletic prowess. I've added green drinks to my diet for the last several years - it is primarily the reason I am no longer having to medicate my digestive tract with Prilosec or other drugs. It is responsible for my weaning myself off allergy meds like Zyrtec. I have more energy than when I was in my 30's and 40's and happy to celebrate my 55th birthday this Friday by climbing Mt.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Daniel H.,7/29/20," I love the ingredients used in this supplement and the nutrients that it provides - very comprehensive! The taste is OK but not great - I do not like the taste of stevia so that is a downside and it does not dissolve well in water, it takes way more than the label says to get even partially dissolved. ",3
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Jessie J.,7/29/20," I have been taking Athletic Greens since 2011 - 9 years and it does all that it promises to do. It replenishes that fatigue feeling that I get after a hard workout or a terrific day on the slopes or bike ride. When I go skiing I take it in the morning and when I return. It is also an excellent source for hydration. Even after a Chinese dinner that sometimes makes you so thirsty I had taken Athletic Greens to restore my fatigue after a particularly tough work out and in a very short time my thirst was completely quenched and satisfied as well.

Truthfully vegetarians don’t look healthy to me, but all due respect to you. A Native American friend who lived traditionally in many ways said to me”I want you to eat buffalo every day, the brown fat is good for you (it naturally does not have much fat anyway) I did some research and found that buffalo (bison to those of you who don’t live in buffalo country) has some amino acids that are very difficult to get elsewhere.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Thomas K.,7/23/20," I get asked about it almost daily at the hospital and I promote it to everyone I know. Favorite feature is the promotion of gut health. The protective lining in our stomach is approximately half the size of a strand of hair, and we must do whatever it takes to protect it. Without that protection, we can develop ulcers or even leaky gut. Leaky gut is a relatively new concept in medicine and we are finding that makes us susceptible to cancers and degenerative diseases. So I highly recommend athletic greens for gut health. I also highly recommend eating fermented foods as that is the best probiotic for the gut.  ",5

That certainly changed when I was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive, stage 4 gallbladder and liver cancer In January of 2020. I suddenly felt terrible, then began heavy chemotherapy, felt worse, and my body weight plummeted to a low of 155 around mid March. For years I tinkered with various greens mixes, but all of them tasted terrible and were not worth the cost or time of having them. Besides, I took pride in taking no supplements or medications, getting everything my body would need through a healthy, well...fairly healthy diet. I never needed to lose weight, had a great health profile, and so didn’t think much more about any of that. Now I suspect that some of my micronutrients along with omega-3 fatty acids had been deficient for years.  ",4

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,James G.,6/17/20," I like your product very much and have told many others about it. For my son's birthday I gave him the gift of a subscription to AG. My one complaint is your monthly delivery always arrives late. FedEx tracking is inaccurate and it hands off your product to the USPS but at the wrong substation which delays it even more. I'm still waiting for this months supply that was shipped on June 8th and it's the 17th. Don't blame Covid, this has been going on before the pandemic. Why use FedEX at all. If you just shipped with USPS your product would arrive on-time and not a week late. Your excellent product deserves to have punctual delivery. To not have it tarnishes your overall brand. Please use USPS for delivery. ",4

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Marc H.,6/17/20," For the price point I expected to be blown away. I drink it on an empty stomach every morning as breakfast. It tastes really good, better than any other greens supplement I’ve ever had. And it does seem to balance me out nutritionally.  etail is in your scoop. It is extremely poorly designed. First the handle is very very VERY short. So you can’t leave it in the bag for convenience. If you do, it gets lost in there and unless you have extremely tiny hands you end up with fingers covered in green powder. Then the diameter of the scoop is just slightly smaller than the diameter of the athletic greens shaker cup.  ",1

Then I lived in Australia for a few years and couldn’t get it there. Now I’m back and promptly got my deliveries started up. It’s that good. Goodness, all kinds, is desperately needed right now.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Ethan T.,6/11/20," It’s hard to make an objective assessment of the benefits I’ve derived from Athletic Greens. In short, I’m a fan. The biggest change is with how my digestive tract has responded. Some foods, particularly energy bars, would clog my system and cause uncontrollable gas. That’s no longer an issue. And, perhaps as a result, I’ve lost at least 6 pounds. Losing weight has particularly helped my bike riding performance when climbing hills. I’m not sure if I feel have more energy but I am riding better. Is it the Athletic Greens or that plus being comfortable riding with more effort? I can’t say.

I got into this by listening to the Tim Ferris podcast, and I thought it must be good. I like that it contains a lot of daily necessary ingredients as listed on the information. The taste was definitely not as delicious as presented, it was a bit awkward at first, but I definitely grew into it overtime and I do kinda enjoy it now.

I am very impressed with the packaging and product. As for the actual powder itself, the taste was better than i expected. At the end of the day, it is a greens drink so no it doesn't taste like chocolate milk, but it also didn't taste like dirt mixed with water.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Mike S.,6/9/20," So, I'm definitely not a doctor or scientist, and this is only my anecdotal data, but I feel that I have to share my experience. I'm 59 years old, and had a full thyroidectomy a little more than 5 years ago. I am not an athlete, but I walk 5-7 miles/day, eat clean, and do resistance training every day. I have never been able to recapture the same energy levels as I enjoyed pre-cancer. Perhaps 80-85% as a baseline. Before my cancer, my numbers were always good, as I follow a whole food, plant-based diet. In fact, the OR staff expressed amazement at them for a then 54-year old. Surgery went great, and after a year of dialing in the meds, the aforementioned energy levels seemed the best I could do. I long ago accepted this, counting my blessing that I'm still alive and generally feel pretty good.  ",5

I also take Daily vitamin D supplements, and monthly B12 shots to boost my energy level. I eat healthy. So I was already feeling pretty content with my lifestyle when I decided to try Athletic Greens. Once I started taking it, I felt a significant difference in the way I feel. I have more energy now. To work, workout, take my dog on long walks, do household chores... to do all of that in a single day, which I was struggling with previously. Because I would get tired quickly, and needed to take naps in the middle of the day. Now, I feel much more energized. And I’m pretty sure it’s not placebo because I went into this very skeptic. I wish it was more affordable, but I would recommend it nevertheless. ",5

Then work from home happened so I decided to get serious about health habits. WFH meant less coffee, mostly no coffee, but I didn't really feel the drag that I expected. It's comforting that there is so much different stuff in the greens rather than taking a handful of supplements, and it helps me start my day off with some hydration, which I admit I've not been in the best habit of. They taste great, and they're really refreshing. I'm just starting month three and I'm definitely in for the long haul! ",5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,John K.,5/25/20," Hi! My name is John and I am 62 years old and I am not an athletic person. But I started taking Athletic Greens June of 2015, 5 Years ago! A 30 day supply 1 serving a day. Then changed to 2 servings a day about six months later and have been taking Athletic Greens since 2 times a day. Why? Because I feel much better, I don't get sick that often and I get the nutrition I need. I wouldn't be taking Athletic greens if it didn't make me feel better. I do endorse Athletic Greens! Unfortunately my friends won’t pay the price. It would be nice if Athletic Greens would give us seniors a little break!!! Living on a fixed income is not easy and it is pricey but it does a good job for me. I might be happier if you added some THC to your product. Just think about it! This may be possible one day. ",4

All I know is that Kristina Hess, my nutritionist, says I don't have to eat 10 servings of vegetables a day if I do my Athletic Greens everyday so that is good enough for me.to drink my greens instead of eating them. I feel great, my skin looks really healthy. I love my Athletic Greens in plain water, in the almond/Greek yogurt/Blueberries drink I make for breakfast when I am in a rush or hungry in the afternoon. I can take the pakets with me anywhere and when I am starving and there is nothing else to eat, the Athletic Greens come to my rescue. I don't have bad breath either because I take the Athletic Greens. They have become a real savior for me because I do want to stay healthy but I can't always eat my daily dose of vegetables.

And I never remember to take it in the afternoon. So I take my shake at night--don't know how the team would feel about that. Though the greens are supposed to supply us with energy, they don't keep me awake, so I figure it's fine.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,JAMES,5/13/20," Good Evening, Chris, I wanted to give you some feedback on how I feel about AG, As you have noted in regards to energy, craving, and a healthy gut. I have never been know to have little energy; some would say that I have too much of it. While drinking AG, I have noticed that my energy levels had even out, less spikes in my mood and more calm throughout the day. I have been doing IF since April 8th, and have used AG as a fast breaker. I feel that as a fast breaker, it gives me everything that I need that I have been missing in the 16 hours of fast, and because it tastes great, I look forward to it every mid-morning. I have had stomach issues all of my life, being in the U.S. Navy and a Flight Attendant for a major airline did not help. You ate whatever on your plate in the Navy, and if you ever been at the airport, then I don't have to say anything; you have seen the available items at any terminal. I am not saying it that overnight it stopped, but little by little, my stomach has been feeling better, and I feel better. I wanted to thank you for Athletic Greens - a great way to even out spikes of energy, a fantastic tasting fastbreak, and great for the gut. ",5

She outlined a topical remedy to try to address the lump, and I did that faithfully, the lump did shrink but never went away completely. If I forgot to do the remedy for a few days, it would start to grow again.

Healthy and delicious...and fuel for my cycling workouts...which culminated in cycling to the summit of Mt Evans in Colorado with a good friend last July. At 14,130' it's the highest paved road in North America and according to Bicyling Magazine the #1 most difficult of the 30 most challenging mountains to cycle up in the world. Thank you Athletic Greens for helping to keep me healthy, strong and well nourished. Matthew Carr ",5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,John K.,4/7/20," If you are health conscious and believe in the idea that food is fuel, you need to add this to your daily nutrition. I am an age-group endurance athlete (5xIronman) and have been taking Athletic Greens daily for about a year now. I honestly I expect to be a customer for life - and I'm only 32. I feel much healthier and, anecdotally (I know), seem to bounce out of bugs without getting sick-sick when I pick them up. It also reduced the pressure on me to eat piles of leafy greens and veggies to get similar nutrients throughout the day. I've heard the taste of this is better than other green drinks, and I wouldn't say it is delicious, not gross. It grows on you - but it isn't supposed to be a milkshake. I also initially thought it was expensive - but remember - food is fuel! What are you putting in your body?! This is worth it. ",5

You can tell when you stop taking it or when you take a little more which means that it’s making a real difference. The cost is a little prohibitive, but that’s part of a quality supplement. I wish my parents would take this. It would make a great difference for their health at their age, mid 50’s. I plan to continue taking this for the foreseeable future even though I often take half scoops to stretch out the bag. Really amazing supplement! ",5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Julia K.,4/7/20," My name is Julia Kohnen and I am en elite runner from St. Louis, Missouri. I run everything from 5ks to marathons, but specialize in marathons and half marathons. I recently won the Twin Cities marathon in October and then went on to participate in the Marathon Olympic Trials on February 29, 2020. I finished 10th at the Olympic Trials and set a new personal best time of 2:30.43 in the marathon. Eating healthy, having the right diet, and exercising regularly have always been a big part of my life. My training regimen now consists of running 90 to 100+ miles a week. When I heard about Athletic Greens, it spoke to everything I believe in and strive for - healthy lifestyle, natural living, and bettering your athletic performance. I have been taking Athletic Greens to start my mornings for a few months now and I can say it really has helped me feel better. I have more energy, don't feel as bloated or have as many digestion issues, and feel that I am getting my day off to a good start with my greens and essential vitamins. Adding this to my regular habits of eating healthy and exercising has only increased my athletic performance. I can't say it is all due to Athletic Greens, but I can say I am very happy with this product and will continue to use it! I even added the Athletic Greens protein powder to some of my recent orders and must say I am enjoying that too. I do not take any other vitamins or supplements, but coming home from my daily morning run and drinking my Athletic Greens or adding it to my morning smoothie makes me feel that I am getting all the nutrients I need to recover from my morning runs. Thanks Athletic Greens for giving me the right supplements to start my day :) ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Jamesdcrow@gmail.com,4/4/20, I loved A G's everymorning while I was working. Had to retire on disability at 65 it converted to SS after two years inflation primarily at the local grocery stores priced me out of the market two years ago. But I still remember how well I felt taking it. ,5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Hugh K.,4/3/20," Athletic Greens is pricey, no question, but the best things you put into your body to nourish it tend to be. It's clear that this company has put a tremendous amount of research into the product, and continues to. At the very, very least, you can't argue the logic of putting 8-10 ounces of fresh water into your system as soon as you wake up. The AG concoction itself seems to instill a big surge of clean energy as it travels into your gut, and I don't miss taking a multivitamin one bit. The staff is tremendous as well, and when one of my shipments was stolen from the lobby of my office building, there was no bickering; they immediately sent me a free replacement. So AG runs on quality from start to finish. ",5

Highly recommend to any other home chemists out there. ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,CG,3/29/20, I really like the product a lot. The problem I have is the packaging… I wish that you would stop putting the plastic measuring cup in the bag every month. This adds a lot of unnecessary waste and how many of these does a customer need to collect? ,4
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,James,3/25/20," I’ve been using Athletic Greens since about January 2020 and I’ve noticed better sleep, improved complexion and stronger immunity. I highly recommend Athletic Greens! ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,J. N.,3/24/20, I’ve been using Athletic Greens for about a month and love the way it makes me feel like I’ve got a head start on each day. I re-ordered a couple of weeks ago and contacted customer support when my ordered seemed to be taking a little longer than expected. They responded very quickly to explain shipping issues and not only got my order setup with their new shipping vendor but sent me some complimentary items for my trouble. It was completely unexpected but I am extremely grateful and will recommend to my friends. ,5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Tina M.,1/6/20," I have just completed by first month of Athletic Greens. I consider myself pretty darn healthy and do lots of preventive things including regular exercise, avoiding sugar, plant based eating, good sleep habits, stress management and plenty of water. After 3 weeks of Athletic Greens the change in my skin tone was undeniable and many people noticed that I looks much more vibrant and even younger. I have felt the digestive benefits and I am sleeping much more sound as well. For now I cannot say if my mood, focus, energy or hormones have changed noticeably but look forward to seeing more long term benefits with continued use. ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Ashley B.,12/19/19," I love athletic greens!! I have FELT and PERFORMED so much better since I started taking them a few months ago. I also upped my intake to 2x/ day during peak training for my most recent Ironman, and slept better. Most notable improvements for life/training: sleep quality, training recovery, training, mood, blood sugar regulation, body composition. I work in the fitness industry, and have regular access to an InBody scale, which measures segmental lean, hydration etc (DEXA accuracy) and I was shocked to see my #s. I really didn't change much else in my diet (aside from adding Athletic Greens), but my BF% was very very race ready.. moreso than EVER before. Mostly I'm appreciative that I feel happy and physically well consistently. Thank you!!! As a Certified Strength Coach and Sport Nutrition Specialist, I have definitely recommended this to other coaches including my own. The recent NSF certification is HUGE, and I'm incredibly confident in the brand... as a person, athlete, and coach. one more thing, it tastes good. ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Mimi,12/2/19," I really enjoy your product and as the reviews below indicate, so do many other people. What bugs me though is having to reach in the bag and trying to pick up the scoop every time, and getting all that yummy green powder all over my fingers. So if I may suggest, is there a way to attach a little pouch/holder for the scoop either inside or outside the bag? That would ensure that the scoop stays out of the powder and the powder off the fingers :)  ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Drew,11/27/19, Sustained energy. More regular digestion. I love the branded shaker y’all provide. 2 months in and loving it! ,5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Rachel,11/18/19," I am an athlete always on the go with a sensitive stomach, and I truly noticed a difference in the way I felt everyday when I drank it.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Joe,11/8/19," Athletic greens is worth every penny. It's an all in one supplement that checks so many boxes. On top of it, they take care of their customers. They sent a package that was opened, and upon request they immediately sent me a replacement. Can't say enough good things about this product and company. ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Vanessa A.,10/31/19," Every time I try a new “green superfood supplement”, I’m prepared to choke it down, because let’s face it, most of them taste awful! I did a lot of research and comparisons before trying Athletic greens and I am very pleased. The taste is actually very refreshing, pleasant, sort of earthy. I’ve been taking this supplement for a few weeks now and feel like I have more energy! Thank you athletic greens! ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Grace H.,10/19/19," I was so excited to receive my Athletic greens in the mail. I first heard about the company on a podcast I listen to regularly and decided to try it out. The product is high quality, no doubt about that! I also was very impressed with the packaging as well as the ceramic storage bowl for the powder- what a bonus! However, I have a major issue with the taste and I'm super bummed! I mixed one standard scoop of the powder using the spoon the company provides into 10oz of cold water per company recommendation and was not feeing it whatsoever. To me, it tastes quite medicinal and has that vitamin taste to it. Of course, this is a supplement so maybe I should have expected that, but I really thought it would taste more like a juice/smoothie as opposed to liquified vitamins. Maybe my expectation was too off for a supplement beverage, but I'm sad I don't like it because I truly believe in the idea of the product. I'm going to see how it tastes in a smoothie so I can hopefully use the product I bought - if not, I plan on sending it back :( ",4
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Bug L.,9/26/19," I struggled to force myself to eat a healthy diet, and frequently felt nauseous, bilious, lethargic irritable, and bloated. After just one week, my gut health began to improve TREMENDOUSLY! This is not a weight loss plan, but the digestive enzymes in this product first helped me APPEAR less bloated, but also helped to regulate my bowel movements AND I started to crave healthier food options. My sweet tooth hasn't been completely eliminated, but all the nutrients and vitamins in this formula have helped curb my desire for sweet, salty, fatty foods and for that, I am eternally grateful. I highly recommend this product. Do yourself a favor and skip the $5 morning coffee and donut routine and after one week you'll feel more energize, alive, and quite frankly, happier. Trust me. Do it.

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Angela K.,9/26/19," I am a 50ish year old female that has dealt with gut issues for years: 2 hospitalizations with Small Bowel Obstruction, Rectal Prolapse and never ending days of constipation. I eat a whole foods diet and fill myself with veggies daily. The problem is I was always bloated and would still go days with out a bowel movement. The doctors wanted me to use Mira lax nightly but I am just not into medicine plus I don't want my system to need it daily to function. I have been using the Athletic Greens for a month and I have never been so regular and without the bloat!!! Absolutely amazing for my gut. I also add a scoop of collagen to the greens just to get a little extra nutritional boost all in one. Thank you for this awesome supplement. ",5

athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,Robert,8/22/19," A couple of comments about the surprise package that was sent out a couple of weeks ago. The box included a mixing bottle, jar and scoop and some travel packets. The mixing bottle is ok for mixing but difficult to drink from. The opening should be a little larger. Right now I am using the bottle to mix than pouring the contents into a glass that I drink from. I like the idea of the jar. Many times I find it difficult to open the large Athletic Green package to get at the product. It may be because the envelope does not tear evenly and it is difficult to pull the two halves apart or that I am getting weak. The jar solves that problem. The scoop is perfect for measuring out a heaping spoonful of greens. Thank you for asking me for my feedback. ",5
athleticgreens.com,Athletic Greens,BRUNO,8/22/19, I have been drinking Athletic Greens for about 2 years. I start my morning with them and cannot imagine a day without them.
