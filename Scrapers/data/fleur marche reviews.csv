m.,1/18/22,CBD Baby Steps,"This was gifted to me by Fleur Marche for review. After going through 4 patches, I recognized that this patch was very subtle and had plenty of calming effects. I'm not too sure about increasing libido but the relaxation felt great. I placed it over my right wrist where I had the most veins showing and it had great effect! These are easy to use and a good baby step toward using CBD wellness products if you're curious.",5

A M.,10/20/21,,"I was pretty hesitant about this product at first. I felt like either it was going to be amazing or a fad. So far, I love this product! I have found it helps me to destress relieve some anxiety. I only got 1 so I am curious to see what long-term use would do. It’s easy to apply and simple to use! I am interested in trying their other products! Lasty, they have the cutest little graphics on their site to help explain the product!",5

J.G.,12/27/21,"I like them, but wish they stuck better","I’d never tried a patch like this before, and I was really excited by the notion that the patch would last 12 hours. They didn’t really last on me—like they weren’t sticky enough? I get like 6 hours of wear with them. I do think they help intensify some of the good feelings, but it didn’t create the feelings…if that makes sense? It’s not like you’re all of the sudden IN THE MOOD. I do like these, and I’d like to try out some of their other patches too.",4
F.L.,1/3/22,Love the concept,"I was super excited to try these patches! I placed it on the inside of my wrist, and the application process was easy to understand. Personally, I did not feel very strong effects from this. I’m not sure if maybe my tolerance is just higher. However, I do think this concept is great and can be great for people who may benefit from the extra relaxation. I will give these patches another try, and hopefully may feel more effects this time.",3
cladja1,3/15/21,A bit more than meh,"The patch didn't stay on for very long (I put it on my wrist), and once it fell off, I couldn't get it to stay on without taping it on. But I think it helped in spite of that. I purchased 2, so we'll see what happens with the next one.",3
L.S.,10/30/21,Meh,"Honestly, I really didn’t notice much of a difference after wearing this patch. I wore it all day, for at least 8 hours and I don’t feel any different. Maybe it is just me, but I probably wouldn’t purchase.",2
D.w.,10/26/21,Meh,"This was super easy to use, however, I don't think I noticed any big difference. It kind of seemed like it might just be a placebo, but I did kindddd of notice a change in my energy levels, but that's about it.",2
D.L.,10/26/21,Didn't work for me,It's a cool concept but I didn't notice a difference wearing the patch. The instructions were clear and I applied it to my right wrist. Effects were either subtle or didn't have any effect on me. ,2
