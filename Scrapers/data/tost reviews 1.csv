0,R. Henry,"Reviewed in the United States on June 8, 2021",Some of the items arrived damaged. Otherwise I really love this product it cuts my wine cravings. Just would like to have them all in one piece especially since it's expensive. Would like to have a replacement since a couple were broken.,"T√ñST Ros√© All-Natural Non-Alcoholic Sparkling Beverage Refresher with White tea, Elderberry, Ginger, 25.4 Fl Oz (Ros√©, Pack of 3)",1
1,Joni LaFerriere,"Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2021","I can no longer drink alcohol and this product is a great substitute! It looks like a sparkling rose in a sophisticated bottle, but contains zero alcohol and NO chemicals. It can be too sweet if I drink too much of it, but is low sugar at only 9 grams. Add a little seltzer to it in a pretty glass and it feels like happy hour without the awful side effects.","T√ñST Ros√© All-Natural Non-Alcoholic Sparkling Beverage Refresher with White tea, Elderberry, Ginger, 25.4 Fl Oz (Ros√©, Pack of 3)",5
