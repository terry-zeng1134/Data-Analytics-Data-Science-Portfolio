1,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,01/28/2022,Smooth and perfect,5
2,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,01/24/2022,I wasn't expecting much out of Jot because I've been underwhelmed by DTC brands before but I was so pleasantly surprised! The concentrate is great hot or iced. It's the perfect thing to keep at my tea-drinking girlfriend's apartment so we both can drink what we want in the morning.,5
3,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/31/2021,Love the taste and convenience,5
4,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,12/29/2021,i love the taste of jot! so easy to make a quick cup of hot or cold coffee.,5
5,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee,12/27/2021,"Love how easy it is to make a GOOD cup of coffee.  Best of all you have the coffee liquor you need for many recipes and cooking.  LOVE the taste!  Though a little strong, but great!",5
6,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/20/2021,"Jot Jot Jot I got more than I bought! I really like the Ultra dark version, I can feel the caffeine right away. The Original taste is good but I prefer roast flavor like the dark version. Very easy to make and fast too! Can't wait to try the limited edition flavors!",5
7,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/17/2021,"I really enjoy the convenience, but the taste is where you win me over!  Easy, organic, and tasty! Thank you",5
8,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/17/2021,"Great, smooth taste, easy for making my daily iced coffee, but prefer to have a decaf option",4
9,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/16/2021,This coffee is by far the best coffee I have had. I highly recommend it!!!,5
10,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/16/2021,"I love the coffee concentrate! It makes my coffee routine so quick in the mornings, and it tastes great.",5
11,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/15/2021,So smooth.  Zero bitterness.  Not acidic.  Full coffee flavor.  Just gorgeous.,5
12,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/13/2021,"Nothing at all against Jot or this convenient coffee concept.  I am traditionally a pour-over drinker and enjoy the depth and rich flavor of my coffee.  I found Jot (dark) to be rather flat and somewhat bitter - even after experimenting with the quantity (from 1T to 3.5T).  Overall, this is clearly a win for a lot of people - but for someone who enjoys a bold, flavorful, rich cup of coffee, this may not be for you.",3
13,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,12/12/2021,Creamy rich and very tasty.  Little to nothing extra needed.  Strong too,5
14,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/12/2021,Don’t have time to brew a perfect cup of coffee but I love a nice tasting coffee. This changed the game completely and I can make a full latte in 1 minute that taste great!! Saving time without sacrificing flavor,5
15,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/12/2021,"I enjoy the convenience of having any strength coffee I want, any time of the day.  However I find Javy just as good and convenient, at about half the cost.",3
16,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/12/2021,This has such a clean and delicious flavor.   strong but not bitter.   The few people I have shared this with have all asked me what kind of coffee/how I brewed it because it tastes so good!,5
17,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/11/2021,Saw the ad on Instagram. Looked cool so I decided to bite since it came with a cool looking cup too. Kinda bummed it didn't have that cool teaspoon lol. The coffee is easy to make and tastes better than the k cups we buy. I'm glad we bought it.,5
18,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/11/2021,"I saw Jot on the odd day that I was on Instagram.  Funny thing about it - I use instant coffee in a pinch and when camping - it’s not my favorite, but I like my coffee.  
Anyway - I tried placing an order and just wasn’t ready - then decided I would just do it!  I’m so glad I did.  The first cup was delicious… and when I didn’t have time to finish it while it was hot - when it cooled to room temp it was still really amazing!

Jot may have to be my go-to for amazing and delicious coffee!!!",5
19,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/11/2021,I have been enjoying Jot every morning…it gets me going and has a wonderful full flavor. I bought a mini coffee/drink emulsion type of blender and that made the drink taste even better. I highly recommend and would be a great gift to a coffee-loving friend.,5
20,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,12/11/2021,My husband loves Jot coffee. It is so convenient during the hectic morning - getting the kids out the door to school. Tastes much better than coffee concentrates which are convenient but lack the awesome flavor of Jot. Very happy to have found this product!,5
21,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/11/2021,I absolutely love Jot coffee. My daughter made me a cup at our Thanksgiving gathering. One cup and I was hooked. Made my order the next day. Thank you!,5
22,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,12/10/2021,"There are a dozen cold brews on the market and no real way to differentiate them, so I went with the one endorsed by Tony Hawk. I'm not typically susceptible to celebrity advertising, but what a rad guy, right? Prior to delivery, I vacillated between proudly hand-grinding beans and brewing in a french press and shamefully grabbing multiple black coffees from Starbucks Those parts of my life are over. Not only is Jot wildly convenient, I've never had this type of first-cup boost from coffee. I'm a marketing director and a night owl—not the best combination when you need to be firing on all cylinders early in the morning—and I am now soaring through my mornings.",5
23,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/09/2021,I placed an order for the dark and original. the dark roast is very smooth and easy to add various flavors. the original on the other hand was Extremely bitter had pieces of ground coffee and was just plain bad. I'm taking it as a bad Bach.,3
24,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/09/2021,I first ordered through Amazon because I only wanted one bottle to try and to be honest Amazon was a little cheaper (free shipping). Sorry Jot. I absolutely enjoyed every drop. This month I ordered the duo straight from Jot.,5
25,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,12/09/2021,I enjoyed the rich taste and the convenience of this coffee.,5
26,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/08/2021,I got the Duo to try. I'm an iced coffee a day on the way to work person. I wanted to save a little time off my commute by not having to make an extra stop for caffeine. I started with the Original and it was just okay. After I finished that bottle I opened the Dark. It was delicious and what I was looking for. I'll be sticking with the Dark for now and I'm interested in checking out the seasonal blends.,5
27,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,12/07/2021,"excellent cup of coffee, fast",5
28,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/07/2021,This stuff is absolutely amazing. I am going to make sure I keep my subscription.,5
29,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/07/2021,So good. Loved every sip!,5
30,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,12/07/2021,I couldn't believe how much I would love drinking Jot! I am a coffee lover and I now work from home and decided to give it a try based on a friend's referral. I am so glad I did because it has changed my whole outlook on my day! I look forward to that first cup of Jot in my iced oatmilk.,5
31,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/07/2021,Friends bought me my 1st Jots. I was hooked. I bought the dual pack to give as Christmas gifts.,5
32,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/07/2021,"Coffee and water have different textures. You know what I’m talking about fellow coffee enthusiast. I’ve had other coffee concentrates and they just taste like coffee tinted water, and if I added more it would just make me jittery. Jot has the right coffee texture, only needs the 1tbspn to actually taste like coffee, and no jitters. It’s my new go to afternoon pick me up coffee and I’m glad I found it",5
33,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/07/2021,"Delicious, low acidity, easy to make. Solid",5
34,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/07/2021,I’m all about a quick caffeine fix. This is pretty awesome! I’ll def be ordering more.,5
35,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/07/2021,I normally make my cold brew coffee with a Toddy and thought this would be better or different flavored. But was kind of disappointed. It’s good coffee but expected more for the price.,3
36,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/07/2021,"Its not Starbucks, overpriced, over sweetened, over hyped.  Its good, smooth, coffee. its easy, and good. Yes, worth every penny!",5
37,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/07/2021,This coffee concentrate is so convenient and a little bit goes a long way!,5
38,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,12/07/2021,"Smooth,creamy, worth drinking, didn’t need a second cup to be awake.",5
39,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,12/07/2021,"Smooth,creamy, worth drinking, didn’t need a second cup to be awake.",5
40,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/06/2021,Smoothest coffee I've ever had.,5
41,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/06/2021,I don’t joyed the first cup. I can say I was surprised at how it tasted and how versatile it is in regards to iced coffee or even a hot cup,5
42,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/06/2021,No one will take care of the fact my glasses arrived broken 😤,5
43,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,12/06/2021,"I thought my first cup was pretty smooth. Quite frankly every cup thus far has been consistently smooth and tasty, which I like.",5
44,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/06/2021,Hot or cold this coffee had me ready to yeet right into my day! I am grateful for this cup of Joe. :),5
45,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/06/2021,Love it! The taste is amazing am never going back to regular or Starbucks,5
46,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/06/2021,She is a teacher and is always in a rush but is a straight coffee junkie. She loves the taste and how simple and fast it is to prepare.,5
47,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,12/06/2021,At expected to be disappointed with the first cup but was pleasantly surprised at the full flavor with no artificial taste or weird after taste.  I strongly recommend Jot!,5
48,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/06/2021,Gave two bottles of jot as a gift and it was very well received. I tried it recently and loved it as iced coffee. Very smooth and great taste!,5
49,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/05/2021,tastes the same as the espresso I get from my espresso machine,5
50,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/05/2021,"Never one to trust online reviews that have all capitals letters and !!! In it, but this coffee changed my mind. Great coffee, very smooth. Perfect for those who want a quick caffeine pick up, definitely would buy again",5
51,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/05/2021,I am actually really enjoying it. The dark roast is really good. I am a simple man who likes his coffee simple sooo. I drink it black over ice. With a spoon of sugar. And it’s been great so far.,5
52,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/05/2021,"After reading about Jot I assumed it was very concentrated but I had to add numerous tablespoons to even taste the coffee in my oat milk. Its a great idea to save money on buying coffee, its just not for me.",3
53,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/05/2021,"I was back and forth on whether or not to give this a try after seeing it advertised on Instagram and finally caved and I'm glad I did. I ordered the bundle that came with the thermos and loved it! Overall I think think the product is great and makes it very convenient to throw together some delicious coffee when you're short on time (much easier to just use some Jot rather than deal with coffee grounds). I work in healthcare and it's perfect for those days when you want coffee but also need to rush out the door at an ungodly hour. My one comment is that for those who are caffeine sensitive, avoid drinking this in the afternoon! When I drank this around 2pm, I ended up not being able to fall asleep the night after.  

Overall, great product but will subtract a star due to the price. I think if you're the type of person to buy coffee everyday then you'll definitely save with Jot, but if you're the type of person to just make coffee at home usually, this is a more expensive option.",4
54,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/05/2021,Got this for my girl as a birthday present and she carries around that bottle like it's her baby haha,5
55,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/04/2021,"As a busy doctor, I appreciate the incredible convenience of Jot.  Quality flavor is not sacrificed either as my inner coffee connoisseur taste buds are delighted with each sip.  Pairs well with oat milk on night shifts!",5
56,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/04/2021,"I am sold! I don’t drink coffee daily but when I do I want it to be fresh, hot and delicious. Jot is perfect! I can have a hot cup to warm my soul and wake me up or a cold cup as needed. So good!",5
57,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/03/2021,"I was seeing a lot of ads for Jot and decided to check it out (I've been drinking coffee since I was 9 years old. I may have a problem). The purity of the coffee extract and the simplicity of just needing to add a tablespoon to make hot OR cold drinks were the biggest selling points for me. I live alone and don't like the waste of a Keurig/k-cups nor do I want to make a whole pot for myself. Jot seemed like a great alternative. However, I was hesitant to pull the trigger since the price point is a bit higher than my current coffee budget. I signed up for a 2-bottle subscription and figured I could cancel if I didn't like it (the subscription discount helps). A few days later, my shipment arrived and after that first cup I thought, ""Well s***. I'm hooked"". I already had 4 cups by my second day. Overall, I'd rate the product 10/10. I also recommend getting the metal tablespoon.

Enough about the coffee - the customer service is what sealed the deal for me to become a customer for life. I accidentally placed a duplicate order because I have the tech skills of a Boomer in the (high caffeinated) body of a Millennial. I emailed Jot on a Friday at 11:00pm PST and received an email back THE NEXT MORNING AT 8:00AM! Angelique (who is also a cat mom as I saw in her email signature; not relevant, but I love that personal touch) has helped me with many of my questions, including replacing an iced coffee glass that was cracked in transit. 

Making the coffee is easy (and delicious). Customer service is easy. It's really a no-brainer.",5
58,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/03/2021,"This coffee is amazing in every way! It’s delicious, easy on the stomach, and it’s better than any coffee out there. Well worth every penny!",5
59,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Encore (Limited Edition),12/03/2021,Bought this as a gift for my husband to try and he loves it! Specifically asked to never run out of it. Convenient for home or office too.,5
60,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/02/2021,"This coffee is absolutely amazing and has revolutionized how I'm making and drinking coffee. But, I do really wish you also offered a decaf concentrate!!",5
61,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/02/2021,"Dark bottle was really good, we normally buy iced coffee in the bottle at the grocery store and this seems to be better and more cost saving.",4
62,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/02/2021,"Ordered Jot after hearing good things from friends, & I'm glad I did! I have been making a daily latte at home with a moka pot or espresso machine, which does take a small chunk out of my morning with cleaning & all. Jot solves that by giving me more time to enjoy my latte rather than cleaning up. Will definitely keep using Jot in the future when I don't have as much time in the morning!",5
63,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/02/2021,"I was really skeptical about this, but I work a job that requires me to be on call 24 hours a day and sometimes requires me to get out the door on short notice overnight.  I figured Jot would be a quick way to bring a little caffeine with me on my way out the door. I've tried instant coffees and premade coffees but never liked the taste.

I was totally shocked. Jot is delicious and surprisingly smooth and easy to drink even on an empty stomach at 2 am rushing out the door. Now instead of waiting for pour over I add a tablespoon + splash of Jot Dark to my mug and warm milk for a quick latte or make it iced when it's warm outside.

My husband found that he puts less sugar in his coffee when he drinks Jot too! 

I'm so glad I tried Jot. It might even replace our regular coffee.",5
64,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/02/2021,"I love how quick and easy jot makes my morning coffee! The only thing I have to do is decide if I want it hot or cold, stir in a tablespoon and I’m ready to go. Thanks!",5
65,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/02/2021,"It makes a great cup of coffee. We go through a fair amount of concentrated coffee and I fell this is the best tasting product out there. It tastes like good, strong coffee while others end up tasting watered down. Would highly recommend picking up a bottle if you’re on the fence.",5
66,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,12/02/2021,"I love keeping a bottle of Jot in my office for that afternoon pick-me-up without having to run to an expensive coffee shop or brew a whole pot. It's the best tasting concentrate, and I love that you can decide hot or iced on a whim. Also perfect for camping trips. Now to make it air-travel friendly....hmm....",5
67,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/01/2021,"This is a clever idea. It is one less thing to bring if you plan on having coffee on the road.  I have it at home for iced coffee while I leave the opened bottle in the fridge with some creamer.   

During my hunting trips, I bring this and a small jetboil for hot water; it eliminates waste of pour over kits/filter/coffee grounds and gives me all the coffee I could want with the same taste as home.  Plus I love the Fellow mug I got with my order!",5
68,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/01/2021,"I’m no coffee snob and I could appreciate something for what it is. There’s no grinding involved or barely any work at all. Just pour, swirl, and drink. I think for what it is it’s very good. I’m somebody who needs to wake and be out the door in a short time and this works for me. As for the taste that’s subjective, and I happen to like the dark because I like a strong taste.",5
69,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Encore (Limited Edition),12/01/2021,"I roast coffee for a living and drink killer coffees all day long. I’m not a cold brew fan, so I wasn’t expecting much from Jot. To my surprise, whatever their brewing method is, it makes great coffee, I drink it iced, my wife drinks it hot, we take it with us when we travel, WAY better than a pod or bad hotel coffee. The limited single that we recently bought is really good, the dark is too dark for me, but probably cuts through milk well, the original is my jam!  5 Stars, thanks y’all.",5
70,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Encore (Limited Edition),12/01/2021,"This is my first experience with Jot and I’m pretty much loving it so far. Haven’t tried it hot yet, but cold with a splash of creamer and it’s pretty great. Easy and quick too, so I don’t have to make a pot in the morning anymore.",5
71,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/01/2021,"The smoothest, time saving way to enjoy that morning cup of coffee. Seriously smooth and not bitter AT ALL! Great way to start your day or for a late morning pick me up. Easy and convenient too. Already placed my second order.",5
72,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,12/01/2021,Tasty and easy to make,5
73,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/01/2021,"Great coffee on the go is hard to find but a tablespoon of jot and 8oz of water is all you need. Gone are the days of nasty coffee. This easy, quick, and tasty.",5
74,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,12/01/2021,Seriously the best coffee I’ve had and SO easy to make. Have not used my nespresso coffee maker since I’ve received my jot order!,5
75,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/30/2021,I bought this for my daughter who only drinks iced coffee and is a new teacher in NYC and she is hooked! Thank you for making it easy for her to make her coffee at home quick before she leaves in the morning!,5
76,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/30/2021,"I was a little skeptical about trying this, I’m very particular about coffee. This is so smooth, it’s great iced or hot, and it doesn’t make me jittery or give me heartburn which is amazing!",5
77,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/30/2021,"Although there are better tasting and fresher options out there, Jot coffee was an interesting and appealing experience. The main selling point is clearly the convenience of being able to make a cup of hot or iced coffee instantly. Another unstated feature is being able to control the strength and taste of your drink by adding more or less concentrate as desired (some days call for more caffeine than others). As someone who frequently makes their own fresh cup and cold brew it is often difficult to get the ratios just the way you want it.",4
78,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Encore (Limited Edition),11/30/2021,The flavor was great! Love the  pour spout!,5
79,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/30/2021,Delicious! ,5
80,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/30/2021,I mixed my first cup of Jot with some water and flavored creamer and poured it over ice and it tastes great! I'm excited to try the Jot Dark next 😄,5
81,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/30/2021,"The only negative I can say about Jot is that I go through a bottle in about 6-7 servings.  I typically drink a LG iced coffee which is about 12-16oz of water.  If you are a consumer of iced coffee, this coffee is amazing, but the price per cup makes me second guess the subscription.",3
82,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/30/2021,"I love the idea of highly concentrated coffee and it definitely save a lot of times in the mornings, however it is lacking something i look for in my Cold brew and that is a rich body.",4
83,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/30/2021,This coffee is so delicious!  I use it to make cold brew & it saves me so much time!  I used to brew my own about twice a week.  This coffee is somehow more delicious & more convenient & takes up way less space in my fridge! Win win win!,5
84,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/29/2021,This was the first time I have ever ordered coffee like this...AMAZED does not even come close to how I felt when I tasted my first cup!! It was like drinking professionally made gourmet coffee and it only took me a couple of minutes to make!! I definitely recommend buying this product if you love coffee!,5
85,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/29/2021,"I travel for work and was excited about being able to bring Jot with me to start my out of town day in locations where good pre work coffee is hard to come by.

I purchased both the original and dark versions of the product and this review is based solely off of trying the original flavor.

I hate to report that I was underwhelmed by my first cup of coffee I made with Jot. Unfortunately after trying it a few more times that impression has not changed. I believe it to be a high quality product but I just am not excited about the taste profile.

As mentioned I travel for work and was looking for a prework coffee option in places where that can be hard to come by. I currently use Starbucks Via packets for that.

I didn't find Jot to be any better from a taste standpoint and with the recommendation to refrigerate the product and the significantly shorter recommended use by period, I believe, for my purposes, it's a less usable product.

When home I surely don't drink Via, and because of my lack of excitement of the taste of Jot, I definitely wouldn't use it to replace my morning cup/s at home.

Based on my feelings about flavor, for me, both the Starbucks Via, and Jot are compromises on flavor for convenience type products. With that the Via, again for my purposes, is more convenient and more satisfying taste wise.

I believe Jot to be a high quality product which may be right for many. It's just not a good fit for me.",3
86,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/29/2021,"I've been drinking Jot just about every morning and have been enjoying the ease of not having to make a full pot of coffee. I would have loved to see an option for selecting the classic Jot versus having one of each classic and dark (I don't drink dark) so, unfortunately that will likely be given away.",4
87,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/29/2021,This is literally the best coffee I’ve ever had!  It has better flavor than any of the forger coffee concentrates on the market. I can’t get enough!!,5
88,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/29/2021,"This is the most convenient way to make coffee, without having to deal with powder and large containers of cold brew.",5
89,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/28/2021,"Originally, I didn’t get a subscription to Jot.  My thought process was that the product was probably a lot of hype about liquid instant coffee and I wouldn’t go thru a lot of hoops to stop further deliveries and payment. And then, I got my two bottles and was SHOCKED at the quality and intensity of the flavour.  My husband, daughter, and granddaughter were suitably impressed.  

So this time I wasn’t suckered into false claims, I was charmed into the real deal of home lattes with no pricey machine to buy, clean, and store!  Thank you Jot!",5
90,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/28/2021,"It's so simple and tastes absolutely great!
Highly recommend it!",5
91,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Encore (Limited Edition),11/28/2021,"We are really enjoying Jot not only for its flavor but for how easy it is to make really good cold coffee.
It is easily tailored to your own taste and you can drink it hot too but we haven’t tried that yet. 
The limited edition Encore blend is really good and we are so glad we got a chance to try it.😊",5
92,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/28/2021,I was very pleasantly surprised by the coffee I got from Jot. I've never had coffee smoother or easier to prepare. I just wish there was more of it.,5
93,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/28/2021,"I’ve only tried the dark roast so far but it’s amazing. Such a rich, well rounded flavor. No sugar needed!",5
94,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/28/2021,I will be a new repeat customer. :),5
95,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original (Trial),11/28/2021,"In the early seventies, I tasted coffee in South America and there is no going back…. Finally found the BEST TASTING ORGANIC COFFEE on the market. I have tried so many brands and was never satisfied…..
until now…smooth no bitter taste, I prefer the stronger version but both are delicious!",4
96,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/28/2021,I was a bit skeptical at first but now i honestly prefer jot over the iced lattes i was making at home in the morning. I’m even considering bringing a bottle to work so that i can have it whenever i want - which is really saying something since i work in a coffee shop! Might try making some of my normal faves with it too.,5
97,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/28/2021,I love the flavors ,5
98,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/28/2021,I have had plenty of coffee but jot is a whole new level!!! I’m in love,5
99,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/28/2021,I was surprised how smooth the coffee was and how good it tasted in some oat milk.. really delicious and I am definitely going to need more soon!!,5
100,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/27/2021,"Smooth and delicious, so quick and easy, convenient, well-thought out packaging and spill-proof spout. Love it…will definitely order again.",5
101,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/27/2021,"i love it so far — so easy, of course, but also really delicious :)",5
102,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/27/2021,I have been trying to create a yummy coffee to kick my Dunkin’ habit! So far jot has been the closest. I just wish there was more flavor varied to select from,5
103,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/27/2021,After my first cup I have not made a used-to-be my favorite pour-over. It’s really good and extremely convenient. Love Jot!,5
104,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/27/2021,Both the original and the dark are smooth and taste great! It is super easy to make! We have an electric kettle and this makes mornings a breeze.,5
105,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/27/2021,Amazing flavor,5
106,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/27/2021,I take my JOT coffee to the field and share with my Soldiers.,5
107,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/27/2021,I’m glad I came across JOT .  We take it everyday and my daughter shared it with her friends and loved it too.   It’s so smooth and we could put our own choice of creamer.  Great idea for conveniency!,5
108,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/27/2021,It's great stuff surprised how good it is in comparison to regular coffee. I enjoy it more than the ultra dark but both are great.,5
109,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/27/2021,"I found Jot while looking for a way to make really good coffee in my temporary apartment that does not have a kitchen. After experimenting with other methods that also only required hot water rather than any type of a coffee maker appliance I was become frustrated — and frequently resorting to coffee shop drinks. 

Then Jot turned up in my Internet search results, and soon 2 bottles arrived for me to try. I started with the original, and I can’t imagine going back to grinding coffee beans and experimenting with home brew methods. 

From aroma to the last sip Jot coffee is the best coffee experience I’ve had in recent memory. The fact that I can easily make my morning cup to enjoy while paying attention to my early morning zoom meeting makes it nearly unbelievable! 

There is one problem though — I want to drink it throughout the day as I’m a coffee lover, and this is great coffee. 

Any chance of an equally wonderful decaf version being available?",5
110,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/27/2021,The flavors are so smooth that it is the first drink that starts my day. I am instantly overwhelmed with how easy and flavorful each cup is. It is a treat to start a day so positively. Recommended to all my coffee lovers.,5
111,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/27/2021,I liked the first cup but the recipes/ratios don't seem to work as well.  I find myself needing to double the recommended amount to get a good flavor without it tasting watered down.,4
112,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/26/2021,"Quick delivery, delicious flavor!",5
113,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Encore (Limited Edition),11/26/2021,"Didn’t think I would like it as much as I do at the start, then I was always reaching for that bottle on the side of my fridge. Next thing I know I am providing my text so I can get the limited Encore bottles ASAP and scored three; now wish I got more. Who knew!",5
114,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/26/2021,"This coffee tastes great and is so easy to make.  It’s perfect for iced coffee, but we also love it hot!",5
115,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/26/2021,I loved my first cup of iced coffee with jot! The flavor is amazing! Best tasting coffee ever!,5
116,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Encore (Limited Edition),11/26/2021,"When coffee is delicious, it does not need anything like cream or sugar. The best tasting and will keep purchasing. Love at first sip!",5
117,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/26/2021,"For this coffee really shines in homemade lattes and iced coffee. Smooth and delicious and it's as easy as milk, jot, drink. Love it!",5
118,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/26/2021,This is the only coffee my husband will drink.,5
119,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/26/2021,Not much nuanced flavor. It tastes more like instant coffee but slightly upscaled. Flavor is very generic. Makes sense for those who don’t care about premium coffee and can’t tell the difference and those who don’t have time to make real coffee.,3
120,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/26/2021,it’s so easy and convenient and tasty! woohoo!,5
121,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/26/2021,Jot has changed my life! I never run out with the timely subscription! Delicious coffee without an appliance taking up space on my counter. Cold Brew in a snap without giant mason jars in my fridge. I'm fully caffeinated with ease! Thanks Jot!,5
122,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/26/2021,This is some of the best most convenient ice coffee I have ever had!,5
123,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/26/2021,I was so impressed with the flavor of this coffee! Its absolutely amazing. I work so much and this is so quick and easy but doesn't sacrifice taste! I keep making cups for my friends and love watching the surprise on their face when they taste how good it it! 10/10 will buy again!,5
124,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/25/2021,"I only drink coffee when I am craving that distinct flavor and Jot just doesn't quite stand up to a latte with fresh espresso.  That being said, there is no reason it should.  Jot, in my opinion, is an entirely new form of coffee than anything else.  You cannot compare it to coffee or espresso, nor can you expect it to perfectly replace your daily brew.

While this may sound negative, trust me, it's not.  Jot is pretty exciting to me.  While it may not satisfy my coffee cravings, I now find myself in the mood for the flavor of Jot a lot more than traditional coffee.  And even better than drinking Jot, working with it as an ingredient has been great.  

I work in both a kitchen and a bakery.  Jot has provided me with some great new ideas for recipes.  In the kitchen, Jot creates a bold marinade or rub (especially the dark roast) that shines through in the final dish a lot better than a traditional coffee rub.  I have also found that Jot creates a much more natural coffee flavor than coffee extract.  So, to all my bakers out there, try using Jot the next time you make coffee cake or muffins.  I'll add a simplified muffin idea below.

The reason Jot gets four instead of five stars is because I found that the flavor was a bit lacking on its own.  Even unsweetened almond milk seemed to over power the coffee flavor.  Like I said, Jot as a coffee drink was not for me, but it is still a phenomenal ingredient.

Muffin Idea

-Basic Muffin Batter
-Jot (I used a tablespoon of original per 6 muffins)
-French chocolate batons (1-3 per muffin or just mix in chips if you do not have any)
-Cinnamon Brown Sugar Streusel

This is straight up one of the best muffin flavors I have come across.  The Jot really shines through as the star, bring bold coffee flavor to the mellow muffin.",4
125,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/25/2021,Bought jot as a product to make a quick coffee when I didn't want to spend time making pour over or espresso. Now it's part of my normal coffee rotation. Very tasty!,5
126,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/25/2021,"Jot is delicious, quick and easy! All 3 things I need to jump start my day!!!",5
127,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/25/2021,Ultra coffee is the ultra experience.,5
128,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/25/2021,"I normally only drink espresso (i.e., the US version caramel macchiatos) but I seriously look forward to Jot every morning. I love the Carter tumbler thingy that came with the first order because it honestly makes it easier for me…I’m messy and have a toddler (so yay for screw-on lids). It fits in my car cup holder and it just looks slick. I usually do a tablespoon of regular Jot with a splash of the ultra and add a tiny bit of creamer. I’ve made it with milk, water, or half of each and I like them all differently!",5
129,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/25/2021,Tried Javi with high hopes but was a bit flat. Tried hot and was pleasantly surprised. This coming from a guy who spends a little over 3000$ a year at Dunkin 🤣. Happy to find something that tastes good and is so much cheaper. And it's hanging in my fridge. Great taste. Keep on keeping on,5
130,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/25/2021,Tried dark one. It is really good. Easy to have cold or hot coffee first thing in the morning.,5
131,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/25/2021,"Definitely has caffeine, doesn't really taste like coffee kinda bland.",3
132,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/25/2021,"I've had tastier coffee, but this stuff is good a d convenient. I can make it as i walk through the door. I also do mixed drinks with it, and they turn out well",5
133,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/25/2021,I expected it to taste like cheap instant coffee but it doesn't. It's actually very good and makes it so easy to make coffee in a hurry. I'm trying to get my friends to try it.,5
134,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/24/2021,"This coffee is easy, healthy, and sustainable. I love it!!!!",5
135,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/24/2021,My new go-to! This even replaced my religious Starbucks routine.,5
136,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/24/2021,"This is so quick and convenient for when you’re headed out the door. I like to pour in a scoop of Jot, a splash of creamer, and then use the heated water dispenser at work to finish it up (if I’m running really late 😅)",5
137,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/24/2021,"Really good coffee, super convenient",5
138,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/24/2021,"I cannot begin to tell you how blown away I am with this product. This coffee concentrate is an indulgent treat when mixed with your favorite milk!! I enjoy it iced the most and let me tell you Starbucks & Dunkin have nothing on this!!!! When I tell you I was shocked when it didn’t have an old stale taste, no taste of preservatives, or artificial taste!! Nothing put fresh coffee taste here. I mix mine with milk, ice and a dash of creamer and it taste incredible. They now have a lifetime customer from me! I even got a coworker hooked!!!",5
139,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/24/2021,"I drink a lot of coffee and I had seen ads for coffee concentrate for awhile. But I wasn’t too sure about it because I really like my French press and hot coffee. Then I saw a promo for the coffee and for a cup. And my parents always tease me but I really like coffee cups. So I decided to do it. Worse case is that the coffee wasn’t great but I’d get a mug. So I made the first cup and followed the directions. I sat down to eat lunch and took a sip of it and Oh My, it was delicious! I made more that afternoon and have continued to enjoy it.",5
140,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/24/2021,My first cup was the best. Just as I thought it was another coffee trying to get my money. I love and can’t decide which is best the original or dark . All I can say is I need this in my morning to get me going..,5
141,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/24/2021,"Honestly this is an incredible product. Accidently licked the spoon and was bouncing off the walls, but hey caffeine is what I am here for!",5
142,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/23/2021,I really like how little effort I need to put in to make a great cup of coffee. The taste and strength of the coffee are great.,5

144,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/23/2021,It’s ok. I’m kinda disappointed to be honest. The taste is weird,3
145,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/23/2021,"I'm not particularly picky with coffee so long as it's dark roast, but every now and then I taste a cup that has almost a chicory quality to it (?) I'm terrible at identifying flavors but it's just unpalatable to me. When I drink my coffee hot in the morning I keep it simple and though I wanted to love this, I can't stand the taste plain. I can stomach it as iced coffee if I add in flavored creamer or hot chocolate, but as my first cup of the day it's a pass. Love the concept though, service was great, and I would recommend giving it a taste! It's just not my cup of tea.",3
146,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/23/2021,"Initially, hubby said it was too bitter, then too acidic, yada, yada. Then I noticed that he kept helping himself and also noticed that he was using wrong spoons to just pour the coffee. I casually left a measuring spoon and told him that I only use a tablespoon ;) well, to cut to the chase, we had to experiment a bit to get the right combination we each wanted. He now LOVES it! I do too! My preference is the original but we'll have to try all to be sure. My second shipment is on its way already but now you guys owe me some $!! What am I going to do with my coffee machines and its pods??",5
147,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/23/2021,"So easy AND delicious. In other words, fantastic!",5

151,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/23/2021,This really simplifies the coffee routine. I enjoy this as a cold brew alternative mixed with oat milk in a shaken latee. The mug they sell is also great to mix and go. Would highly recommend.,5

154,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/23/2021,"I’m not a big coffee drinker, i hate hot coffee and cold brew is a little expensive to buy the huge bottle or to buy a cup. This is the key. The ultimate shortcut and it tastes really good. It’s tasty energy!!!",5
155,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/23/2021,"I actually bought Jot initially for the gift that came with purchasing two bottles. But after my partner and I tried it, I’m impressed with how good the flavor is. It reminds me more of iced coffee than espresso, but it is delicious. I’ve had it iced while my partner prefers it hot, but we both love the flavor. The customer service has been awesome too, and I appreciate the quick turnaround to receiving my shipment.",5
156,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/23/2021,"I loved my first Jot. I've been using it to make imiations of the skaen espresso drinks, at home lattes, and plain 'ol hot cofee. It's not sour or acidic, and is just so versatile. The only reason I'm docking a star is because one of the glasses arrived cracked. But those were free anyway so 🤷🏻‍♀️",4

159,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/23/2021,"I bought a bottle of Dark and Light to start, loved them both. 2 weeks later I purchased 3 bottles of the Limited flavor and I'll probably be coming back every month to see what new magic they have in store!",5

165,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/22/2021,At first was a bit skeptical of how it would taste in comparison to the cold brew I usually make. Happy to say it tastes like the real deal and is quick to prepare whenever you need a cup.,5

I am saving money and time with this. No longer do I have to drop everything and go to the store to get more cold brew coffee or stop at the coffee shop for a cup, which both choices leads to more spending. It tastes like it should taste. It's up to me how much water I want in my cup. And most importantly, it doesn't take much space in my super-lean refrigerator in my studio apartment.  The subscription part of it is easy to use too.  I'm not kidding, I didn't realize how much time I was investing with either making the cold brew coffee or getting them at the store so frequently, it does add up. I am a true convert!

I had it cold and it was delicious. Will re-order for sure.,5
201,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/21/2021,I was pleasantly surprised that the coffee actually tasted great and obviously is super convenient. I wish the bottles were a little bigger- but the product is delicious,5
202,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/21/2021,"Absolutely love this coffee.  Taste is smooth, and no burnt aftertaste.  I am hooked!",5
203,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/21/2021,"The second I opened the bottle, the smell hit me. It was like opening a brand new bag of coffee. I was wary, but hopeful. I bought this to mix with protein, but I’ve already blown right past that use and tried it several other ways. Delicious!! I’ll be back for more!",5
204,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/21/2021,It’s so nice to just pour your coffee into a glass without having to wake up early to brew it,5
205,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/21/2021,"I’m was a college student stuck in the energy drink loop hole. I was so busy and home very little so that I didn’t have time nor the accessibility to the coffee pot. $3 energy drinks became the norm for my caffeine needs and I noticed a difference. Energy drinks are great but they are heavy in sugar and calories. Jot is as just as easy as energy drinks, but now I don’t have to worry about sugar crashes or empty calories. I just need water, a spoon helps, and I’m on my way to fulfilling my caffeine needs without the guilt. The coffee is high quality and tastes amazing. Don’t see myself going back anytime soon.",5
206,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark (Extra Bottle),11/21/2021,Love the extra punch and it’s delicious.,5

209,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/21/2021,"This coffee is great, keeps my morning running smoothly and has a rich flavor. I was hesitant buying from Instagram, but I’m happily surprised. The Fellow mug is amazing too- keeps it cold all day!",5
210,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/21/2021,I enjoy the coffee. It's great hot or cold.,5
211,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/21/2021,Only feedback is the thermos/cup thingy I received was dented and isn’t useful.  :(. But Jot is delicious.,4
212,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/21/2021,Nice coffee. We love to make it a cup of latte,5
213,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/21/2021,"Loving Jot! My first coffee with Jot was great! I soon realized that since I prefer my coffee on the stronger side, I need to add 1.5 to 2 spoon fulls of Jot to my morning routine.",5
214,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/21/2021,Completely surprised at the smooth consistent depth of flavor of dark and regular coffee from Jot. Fantastic find.,5

217,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/21/2021,I’ve tried a LOT of coffee concentrates—I’ve even made my own! I can say with confidence that this stuff is the BEST (according to my palette)!! The flavor is beautifully balanced. The dark roast is definitely my favorite. I also found that I like it better cold than hot. I bought the two pack so that I can keep one at home and one at the office. I have nothing but good things to say about this coffee and I highly recommend you try it!,5
218,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/20/2021,"I initially thought this product wouldn’t be all that great- I mean- concentrated coffee? This makes me an AWESOME iced coffee every morning, and I am saving so much money and time in the morning skipping my daily on-the-way-to-work coffee from a shop. The dark coffee is the only one I have tried and it is not bitter, doesn’t upset my stomach, is not acidic, and a little goes a long way. I love this coffee and I plan on being a repeat customer.",5
219,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/20/2021,"As the only person In my household that drinks coffee this is the perfect solution to not having to brew an entire pot of coffee just for myself.

221,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/20/2021,"At first I wasn't sure about the whole ""concentrated coffee"" craze. I usually make my own at home but cold brew and other specialties I needed to go to the coffee shop for. When I purchased Jot for my husband I was also pleasantly surprised at the great taste and ease of making a homemade iced latte! I am definitely going to be a repeat customer!",5
222,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/20/2021,"I consider myself a bit of a coffee enthusiast so I was a little skeptical of the premade coffees, but Jot is incredibly smooth and so convenient especially if running late for work. Does not have any aftertaste or bitterness of an overextracted or burned coffee. Very tasty especially when mixed with milk/oat milk. Definitely going to keep some in the fridge.",5
223,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/20/2021,This coffee is delicious and my sweet creamer compliments it perfectly.,5

229,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/20/2021,"Ive tried many different coffee, and Jot exceeded my expectation. Not only it is very smooth and delicious, but it is also very fast and convenient to make. I had to say goodbye to the other coffee.",5
230,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/20/2021,"I think jot is great, it tastes great and has enough strength. Although, the heavy coffee drinkers who had it with me found it to be a bit weak. It's perfect for when I'm in a rush in the morning.",4
231,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/20/2021,I can adjust the strength and it never disappoints!,5
232,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/20/2021,"I was skeptical but it truly is really great stuff!
Thanks for making my mornings easier and for saving me money and time. I don’t have to pay for expensive coffee on the run anymore.",5

236,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/20/2021,"I’ve been addicted to vanilla lattes from a local coffee shop, but I recently tried Jot and I’m so happy I did!! This coffee tastes amazing and is so versatile on how to prepare it. Would definitely recommend!",5
237,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/20/2021,"I usually hate mornings, so I try to minimize my work flow from getting up in the morning, until I really start to wake up about 2 hours later while I'm at work. That usually means I'm groggy for most of that period, and while I'm groggy, I don't want to brew a cup of coffee.

Instead, I tried Jot. And besides the energy I get (which is fantastic!!) the flavor is phenomenal. Smooth, good acidity, low bitterness. I measure my ingredients by mass to make my ratios more repeatable. 17 grams of Ultra Coffee, 25 grams of organic maple syrup, 180 grams of hot water, and top it off with oat milk. Absolutely amazing this way. I honestly wasn't expecting much, but I suppose I'll be keeping my subscription to say the least!",5
238,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/20/2021,"Great tasting coffee, super easy!",5
239,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/20/2021,I love the convenience of Jot and the exceptional flavor is a bonus!,5
240,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/20/2021,I just had twin girls and thought I would try Jot to see if it could save me some serious time without sacrificing quality coffee. Jot has not disappointed! A real lifesaver - I can have a cup of cold brew or an oat milk latte ready in under two minutes. Jot will probably be my go to for gifts to new parents who love coffee!,5
241,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/20/2021,I was suspicious when making this order but this is a great cup of coffee. Definitely better than anything that comes out of a keurig machine,4
242,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/20/2021,"If you are on the fence about ordering this, do it. Way better than expected!!",5
243,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/20/2021,"I have an espresso machine at home but use Jot when I’m in a hurry. Delicious, high quality flavor with an easy convenient process. Lattes in a flash.",5
244,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/20/2021,"Jot is a great product. It's just the right strength and richness, and it takes up much less room in your fridge, as well as you don't have to order or pick up coffee weekly.",5
245,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/20/2021,I have tried other coffee concentrate and didn't like it at all. JOT was really good. It's very convenient for work so you don't have to wait in long lines for your coffee. I definitely recommend,5
246,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/20/2021,I never thought i would like a coffee concentrate after trying so many different ones. Jot is so yummy and so convenient. It gets me through the day. So smooth and the taste isn’t bitter like most concentrates.,5
247,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/20/2021,I was just given jot as a gift and it has quickly become something I look forward to in my morning. The taste is smooth rich and consistent. Making it is so fast and easy on my way to work. I’m hooked. Ill be a loyal subscriber,5
248,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/20/2021,"I was drinking high end coffee at a local coffee shop similar to Starbucks. Each day I would stop in and get my morning fix, and it was costing tons of money! I saw the ad for jot and said to myself “I have nothing to lose” I am so happy I switched to Jot and I LOVE it!",5
249,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/20/2021,"I was thoroughly surprised at the great flavor of Jot coffee. I also love the simplicity: 1 tbsp of coffee, 6 oz of water, and a way we go!",5
250,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/20/2021,"Originally I had little hopes for Jot coffee when I got it as Im not much of a coffee drinker and I get either Starbucks or make instant coffee (which people say isn't really coffee) lol. But upon my first try of Jot, I am never going back to the former type of coffee. It's so rich and just one tbsp goes a long way for me.

Hoping to get more to store and enjoy,
Gloria",5
251,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/20/2021,Unexpectedly powerful in taste. Delicious. So smooth. Perfect with oat milk for my iced latte in the morning.,5
252,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/20/2021,"I purchased both dark and original but so far still drinking the original. I don’t want to lose any flavor so won’t open the dark until I’m finished with the original. OMG, I pours just like a 1/4 teaspoon of it over some Japanese style vanilla pudding which is like a milky custard and it was to die for!!! I can’t wait to make a affogato with it mmmm 😋 it’s a little pricey but the convenience and eco friendliness is worth it! They’re always offering great discounts too.",5
253,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/20/2021,"I’ve been wanting an espresso machine but I realize I still need way more research to do before I actually purchase one.

The flavor is amazing- I made cold espresso shots, iced coffee, iced latte. I will most definitely be ordering more!",5
256,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/20/2021,I'm glad I found this stuff. I've spent the past week enjoying delicious lattes and iced coffee. It's easy to make and tastes good. A little bit pricey compared to my usual coffee budget but worth it!,5
257,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/20/2021,I really enjoy the classic. The dark is a bit bitter but still very good. My favorite thing about jot is how convenient it is to make a cup of cold coffee. The only issue I would have is the bottles are a little small for the price.,4
258,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/20/2021,I love to brew a pot of coffee and hold a warm mug.  This is delicious and great for my on the go or my mid caffeine fix but not all I need.,5

263,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/19/2021,"I consider myself a coffee snob, and I usually only drink beans I grind and brew myself from a Chemex or Aeropress.  I saw an ad for Jot on IG, and thought I'd try it to see if it was a decent product.  After trying it both hot and cold, I'm a believer!  The coffee is smooth and delicious, and takes much less time than brewing it myself.  I'm in!",5

268,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/19/2021,"I have never been a black coffee fan, but this stuff is great. I took my first sip just after mixing with water and there was no need for cream or sugar. Definitely helping me with fasting longer in the morning since I can get my caffeine in without the cream and sugar.",5

270,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/19/2021,I go to bed each night thinking about my first cup of coffee in the morning.  I had been making cold brew for a while but never really 100% satisfied.  My French press was delicious but cumbersome and my hario brewer was easy but needed to be made almost daily.  Being able to add a tablespoon to whatever in the morning is super fast and convenient.,5

276,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/19/2021,"I bought our first Jot as a cost-effective way to make iced coffee in the morning for our 8th grader. It’s great, and WAY less trouble than picking up and paying for a cup en route to school.",5
277,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/19/2021,"So I was just as skeptical as most people, it’s our nature to think it’s too good to be true…but I spend $10 a day on iced coffees, yeah toooooo much. 
Lightly Cynical and in constant pursuit of good things… just found another one, Jot !
Wow!!!  Thanks for the smooth, but full flavored experience. I’ve not had a coffee that you could taste so many flavors and dimensions before and it’s great iced with cream and sugar as well. 
Super job Jot makers!",5

282,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/19/2021,"I’m a relatively new coffee drinker but one that has quickly become a huge fan of cold brew coffee during my day. My partner and I have a Nespresso that I used to drink daily but after finding Jot, I can leave those pods in the cupboard. This is better than the coffees in my immediate area (I live in Manhattan) and I can make a few cups and be out the door in a minute or less. You cannot beat that.",5

288,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/19/2021,"I love having instant coffee in the house for those times I want a quick easy cup, or iced coffee. This was very convenient and easy to make. The flavor was good and smooth. I’m not sure I enjoyed it as much as a freshly brewed cup of coffee, but it was fabulous iced(as good as my cold brew) and it was far better than any other instant coffee I’ve ever had. I will definitely keep this on my pantry for my go to iced and quick cup.",4

For me, the fellow mug makes all the difference because I can’t stand ice falling in my face. I appreciate minimal packaging compared to the plastic jugs I was buying.

But she’s always rushed in the mornings and this seemed like a coffee that could work for her. We got our first box last week and I have to say, we’re impressed. We aren’t throwing out the 1k espresso machine, but y’all, this coffee ROCKS. You know that scene in Wonder Woman where she tells the ice cream dude he should be very proud of his work? That’s me to y’all. It’s really great. I love it with milk on ice with a little of my favorite creamer, but we’ve literally had it every way recommended and then some (I’ve even used it in some of my baking recipes!). We’ve tried both original and dark, and have your limited batch ordered, but so far, we like the dark best. I’m so glad I found your company! Keep up the good work, friends!",5
305,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/17/2021,My wife absolutely loves this coffee. She has tried so many different brands and and roasts but we came across this ad on Instagram and thought we would give it a try. So glad we did because she is absolutely in love with this coffee thank you so much!,5
306,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/17/2021,"I wasn't sure I would like Jot, but since our order arrived, I've told my husband to only brew coffee for himself. I love the toasty warm undertones and the overall flavor of Jot. I only need one cup, but it tastes so good I find myself looking forward to tomorrow morning's cup.",5
307,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/17/2021,"Great tasting coffee, velvety smooth, and not too acidic. The New Instant Coffee!",5
308,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/17/2021,"Surprisingly great, smooth taste….and then the caffeine jolt.",5
309,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/17/2021,"I was really skeptical about Jot and using it for iced coffees.  I must say, I was definitely impressed.  The coffee is very smooth and I find their recommendation of one table spoon (actual measuring element, not an eating spoon) to 8 oz of water is the perfect ratio.  

Delicious!",5
310,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/17/2021,"My search is over for a great coffee!  So glad I found Jot, love it!",5
311,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/17/2021,"I’m literally obsessed!!! I have always done my own cold brew (which is a process to say the least) but now I don’t have to!  Jot is less expensive, more effective, and more versatile than store bought cold brew! Instead of milk, water or creamer, I pair my Jot with a protein shake in the morning! I absolutely looooove it!",5
312,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/17/2021,I was a bit skeptical about the quality of the coffee when I ordered but I was pleasantly surprised by how delicious and convenient Jot is. Jot has completey replaced my cold brew and my wife just started stealing my jot to replace her espresso!,4
313,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/17/2021,"Tastes great, way easy.",5
314,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/17/2021,"Jot provides a quick simple way for getting your dose of coffee. On top of that, it tastes amazing. So much better than instant coffee out there.",5
315,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/17/2021,"Better than a lot of cold brews you pay $5 for at coffee shops. Very smooth, not too acidic. I'm impressed.",5
316,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/17/2021,I ordered hot without high expectations but once it arrived I couldn’t believe how delicious it is. The ease & convenience is also a huge plus! I’ve definitely been converted!,5
317,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/17/2021,"There are several things I really liked about Jot. 1. The bottle is small since it’s a concentrated coffee so it doesn’t take up a lot of precious refrigerator space in our big family. 2. You only need to use a small amount, but that small amount is bold, pretty smooth, and doesn’t have a bitter after taste. 3. I loved the eco-friendly glass bottles and the impressive packaging. Your design team did well.",5
318,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/17/2021,I made a delicious cup of iced coffee to try out jot for my first time. I love it! I prefer this over an iced coffee from Starbucks. The texture is so smooth and the flavor is awesome! I love that it’s not bitter.,5
319,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/16/2021,"Tried my friend's Jot during a camping trip and it was 100X better than the powdery instant coffee I brought for myself. Good taste, great aroma...I'm a fan.",5
320,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/16/2021,Both my girlfriend and I (coffee snobs) were extremely surprised with how good this coffee actually was! We definitely will be trying again,5
321,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/16/2021,"Like how i can have a coldbrew at anytime working grave shift on the roads, highly recommend this product.",5
322,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/16/2021,"The title says it all, this is the best coffee I have ever tasted I have a hard time not drinking more.",5
323,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/16/2021,"Let's talk convenience - It's all in he bottle, a little hot water a tablespoon of Jot and your favorite add-ins and done!  I love this coffee.  I just need bigger bottles.  I am an all day coffee drinker and that means the bottle doesn't last as long as I need it to.  But with home delivery I just order more and viola I am good to go!",5
324,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/16/2021,this coffee is so good... especially love it iced.,5
325,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/16/2021,I purchased Jot because I wanted an easy way to make iced coffee. I just added 8pm water and ice and wasn’t crazy about it. Wasn’t full bodied enough and tasted too watery. It does taste a lot better as hot coffee. I add 6oz hot water and a little hot milk and foam and it’s so much better that way.,3
326,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/16/2021,I have been looking for a iced coffee that would replace the Starbucks options. This seems to be a replacement. The isolated mug included with the coffee was perfect and favor of Jot is great and is very simple to make.,5
327,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/16/2021,"This coffee is so easy to make on the go. When I get up I have to make breakfast, snack and lunch for the kids. It is so easy to just pour one spoon of jot into some almond milk! Highly recommend for those busy mornings.",5
328,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/16/2021,"I’m really bad at waking up and getting ready in time in the morning. With Jot, it’s easy for my to make iced coffee the night before so it’s ready in the morning as I leave. Quick, easy, and energizing! Great tasting too.",5
329,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/16/2021,i found the coffee rich in flavor and appreciate the glass bottle packaging.,5
330,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/16/2021,"Loved it. So much more versatile than other coffee formats...made it with warm oat milk, cold almond milk, hot water, cold water, drank it straight with some ice. And tastes fantastic too!",5
331,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/16/2021,very positive experience with Jot!,5
332,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/16/2021,The original Jot is perfect for someone who isn't an everyday coffee drinker like myself.,5
333,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/16/2021,"I was never an everyday coffee drinker but after trying Jot, I look forward to making my cup of ice cold Jot every morning (and literally lasts me the whole day) with a little peppermint mocha creamer. Definitely something I'm going to continue to implement in my daily routine.",5
334,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/16/2021,"This has totally changed my coffee game. I have been an avid aeropress for years, but wanted some additional convenient coffee that I could make quickly without cleanup. This does the job!",5
335,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/16/2021,So glad that I found this coffee!  I will never go back to any other coffee after Jot!,5
336,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/16/2021,"This coffee does taste good, but it isn't just the flavor that makes it special. It's the idea that you now have the power to charge up anything you want with a quick shot of highly caffeinated coffee flavor. You can get creative without the espresso machine or the mess. The service is wonderful, too. I have had nothing but great experiences and they stand by their product. If you have a reasonable complaint, they take care of it. If give it a 5, but I wish they had a little more to offer and the Dark flavor, while good, is crystallized on the bottom which makes a portion of the bottle unusable, as there is no way way to get it out without washing it out. They have informed me that this is being worked on, however.",4

339,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/16/2021,"I love that I can make a hot or iced coffee in seconds. The hot coffee is so simple, and I don’t have to worry about waiting for brewed coffee to cool before making an iced coffee. Really simplified my morning and cleared some space up on my countertop where the coffeemaker used to sit!",5
340,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/16/2021,I really didn’t expect to like Jot or want to order more but it’s my new go to! It makes the best lattes at home!!!! I also really appreciate that the bottles are glass and not plastic.,5
341,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/16/2021,My cup tastes like coffee and not milk. I add a bit of jot to my coffee flavors to make them dark or when on the run i just have my jot with hot water and I'm out the door. It tastes great,5
342,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/16/2021,So good. Im gonna sign up for subscription its so quick to make as well. And delicious. !,5

344,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/16/2021,So easy when your on the run in the morning. Sometimes I make iced coffee at night so it’s ready in the morning. Love this stuff!,5
345,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/16/2021,"Trialed Jot coffee for the first time to supplement those days where both getting a quality cup of coffee AND making it to work on time is quite the feat. Needless to say, both the original and Dark varieties were delicious! My favorite so far has been 8 oz of frothed oat milk, 1 tsp of any coffee syrup (Lavender is excellent!) and 1 tbsp of Ultra Coffee. Try this product! You won’t be disappointed!",5
346,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/16/2021,I honestly never though coffee could taste this good!,5
347,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/16/2021,I absolutely love this coffee. I don’t really like hot coffee and making iced coffee at home is always time consuming. This coffee is perfect. It’s simple and delicious.,5
348,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/16/2021,"Genuinely impressed! Not only is it simple to make, it's quite delicious. We've taken to combining a small amount of milk (1/4 c) with 200 degree water (3/4 c) to go with the 1 T of Jot. And it's perfect! It is coffee forward, and very convenient. Looking forward to more!",5
349,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/16/2021,"Jot is literally a time saver. I tend to be extremely busy weekday mornings. Getting 3 kids, a husband & myself out of the house by 7:15am is hectic. Jot is so quick & delicious ( we really like the rich bold dark blend ). I grab it to go & it’s perfect every time !",5
350,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/16/2021,"Jot is super fast to make, even faster than a K-Cup, on top of being able to take it anywhere with a fridge (office, home). I am not a coffee snob but it is just slightly off-tasting. That's probably because it's concentration, and it is not in any way bad, but be warned it does not taste like a fresh brewed cup, or even instant coffee. The best part though, is that you can quickly make whatever kind of coffee drink you want, including cocktails. I sometimes eyeball a few drops of original with some water to make the coffee base for Kentucky Coffee.",5
351,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/15/2021,"Im so glad I decided to try Jot out! Its convenient, delicious and quick. Waking up at 430am for work, this makes it so easy to make. I love it. Im a Jot fan.",5
352,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/15/2021,Love the bottle it doesnt drip and make a mess.  I also liked both coffees.,5
353,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/15/2021,"I really love this coffee. I’m a big fan of strong, dark brews, especially iced. Prior to Jot, I was going to Starbucks almost every morning before work. The issue with this was not only the price ($3-4 per coffee), but also the inconsistency. It was really hit or miss - sometimes watery, sometimes too much ice, the list goes on. With Jot, the cost comes out to $1.50ish per work day, and the taste is always the same - which is really good. It’s also super easy to keep it consistent using a tablespoon to measure. I haven’t gotten to try the regular brew yet but I’m sure I’ll like that too. I also really like the travel mug they sent. I told some friends about the coffee and they’re interested too, although they were a little disappointed I couldn’t find that same deal of the 2 brews and travel mug on the website! Definitely going to keep this subscription going. Saves money, time, and my tastebuds from watery coffee. Thanks Jot!",5
354,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/15/2021,I wasn't sure what to expect when I placed my first order with Jot. I often need a cup of joe midday and do not want to make a full pot of coffee. Jot allows me to have the flexibility to have iced or hot coffee whenever I want!,5
355,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/15/2021,I love  how smooth and strong the flavor is..and it's so easy and quick to make. I like a strong cup and Jot does it for me every time.,5

357,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/15/2021,"I was super skeptical about this but oh my goodness- it. Is. So. Good. It’s delicious, good both hot and cold and ridiculously fast to make. There is no bitterness at all! If you like coffee but hate waiting for it to brew you definitely need to give this s a try",5
358,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/15/2021,The first cup was great!  I used the stronger one and love it!!,5
359,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/15/2021,Great product! My middle schoolers is going through a coffee phase and this is the perfect way for her to enjoy her iced coffee without having to make a whole pot for herself.,5
360,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/15/2021,I love the simplicity and how easy it is to make coffee in the morning. The flavor is different than I’m used to but still good.,4
361,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/15/2021,"Love everything about the ease of making my coffee in the mornings now. Ice in my travel mug, tablespoon of coffee mix and cream. Then on my way out the door. The only problem is that the mug I received leaks so I can’t shake it instead of using a spoon to stir it.",4
362,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/15/2021,"I was definitely skeptical of Jot. I've had plenty of bad ""instant"" coffee experiences. But I'm impressed by the depth of flavor Jot achieves and that I can easily tailor the strength to my preference. The coffee has a nuanced, full-bodied taste and mouthfeel. I have no plans to give up my coffee maker, but Jot can streamline a hectic morning. It's also perfect for travel and camping, i.e. no more bad gas station coffee!",5
363,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/15/2021,"Honestly, Jot is just great. I wasn’t sure it would be all that it’s cracked up to be but it really is! It’s so fast and easy for me to now make a strong, delicious cup of coffee at home in the morning. I’m personally a fan of drinking it over ice with almond milk. The flavor is incredibly smooth and bold at the same time. I can’t wait to try doing something more creative with it, like an affogato or an espresso martini.",5
364,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/15/2021,"Ordered this one of my many sleep deprived nights with a newborn. Complete lifesaver for the mornings you desperately need a cup of coffee but can't get your hands free long enough to brew a cup. The taste is amazing - really smooth and I don't even need sugar, when I typically use at least 2-3 tsp per cup. Will definitely be stocking up!",5
365,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/15/2021,Delicious flavor! I will not being getting my coffee elsewhere!,5
366,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/15/2021,So good! Smooth and not bitter!,5

369,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/15/2021,"I absolutely love Jot. I’m an avid cold brew drinker and have never been a fan of cold brew concentrate. But Jot, makes the smoothest cold brew I’ve ever had. I will definitely be picking up more bottles.",5
370,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/15/2021,I'm a coffee snob - I own that. I also sometimes just want a quick coffee. Jot is amazing! Great coffee flavor and do easy! I live to create a quick iced coffee with Jot - superlative!!,5
371,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/15/2021,I am officially obsessed with Jot. I make mine iced with almond milk every morning and it is better than what I order at Starbucks. Cant recommend this enough!,5
372,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/15/2021,It’s delicious. And SO easy. Tastes better than cold brew - is that even possible?? Yes.,5
373,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/15/2021,I am obsessed with Jot!! It tastes amazing and it is so easy to make great coffee at home! Saves me time and money from going to a coffee shop..I am able to have great coffee without leaving my house! I also love that it is shipped straight to me!,5

375,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/15/2021,"I can’t say enough how happy I am with Jot. I keep a bottle at work and I keep a bottle at home. It’s so easy to prepare especially since before not I was brewing my coffee in the morning and then I had to use a bunch of ice to cool it down. (I like my coffee cold, I’m in South Florida) So I was drinking this watery coffee unless I prepared it the night before. I can’t wait to try the new seasonal flavors. Thanks Jot!",5
376,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original (Subscription)| (Ships every 4 Weeks),11/15/2021,"Super convenient and I get a consistent flavor, unlike when I brew my own coffee. As a beginner to coffee, I find this a solid alternative to brewing especially when I'm in a rush. Thanks Jot!",5
377,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/15/2021,"As a lifelong coffee lover, and a recovering home cold brew addict, I honestly didn’t think I would love Jot as much as I do! It’s super easy to mix up my perfect cold drink without the wait time of cold brew, but it’s made me love hot coffee again, too! It’s tasty, easy on my stomach, and versatile (please drizzle it on ice cream and thank me later). My only wish is that Jot would make a decaf version so that I can drink it in the evenings, too ☺️",5
378,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/15/2021,"I’ve been loving Jot.  It’s smooth, easy to make and just hits the spot.  I bought Jot out of impulse from Instagram and I’m glad I did.",5
379,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/15/2021,I have really enjoyed Jot thus far and think it would be great for gifts for co-workers. I would love a non-subscription option for this purpose. The idea of having to cancel multiple subscriptions after an order is a real turn off.,4
380,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/15/2021,The coffee is awesome I love the flavor and I add hazelnut flavoring to it and it is awesome I love it I’m giving a little samples to my friends for them to try it and see what they think hopefully they will order some I do have an order coming in four weeks I am looking forward to getting it,5
381,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/15/2021,Honestly I was a little skeptical when I ordered but I loved to try new things so thought why not. But I was so pleasantly surprised after I first tried it. I like it best iced but still good hot. It is so smooth and not bitter at all. However you brew it and make this concentrate you are for sure doing it right. I normally like dark roast but I really like both the original and the dark just as well. So thank you for my new addition! 😁 Really though to be able to make a really fantastic iced coffee for work every day at home is awesome. Saving time and money in the long run. So thank you for the Instagram ad. 😁,5
382,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/15/2021,I love this coffee. No bitter taste. Easy to make. I cherish every drop of my morning iced white mocha. A little more per serving but helps when you buy multiple bottles.,5

386,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/15/2021,Delicious! It’s a perfect cup of coffee! It’s smooth. No need for cream or sugar because there’s no bitterness. It’s the first coffee I’ve been able to enjoy without cream and sugar.,5
387,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/15/2021,The flavor is rich and has a good balance of acidity that you usually don’t find in pre-made coffee. The bottles are convenient and it’s so easy to quickly make a cup in the mornings. It makes a great mocha!!,5
388,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/15/2021,I have thoroughly enjoyed my first order of Jot! It’s incredibly smooth. There’s no bitterness. I can enjoy this coffee with no cream or sugar. It’s that good. The flavor is amazing. I’m giving it as gifts for Christmas to my coffee drinking friends!,5

390,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/15/2021,I like jot coffee because it has a fresh flavorful taste which goes down smooth every time. It makes you wonder if you ever had good coffee in the past. Also thr liquid formulation makes it much more practical to be used in different recipes. Don't need to grind coffee beans or buy the freeze dried stuff. Really happy with my jot coffee.,5

396,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/15/2021,Tastes great & smooth! A little expensive but really worth it because of flavor and flexibility for cold or hot.,5
397,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/15/2021,"Decided to try this out for my wife.  I'm not a true coffee drinker, but I do drink some heavily creamed latte's.  The wife has her own little coffee bar on the counter that she creates her own concoctions with.  
Ordered the 2 pack and turns out that she liked it... especially if she needs a quick cup to go.  Personally... I've used it for a couple of quick homemade vanilla latte's using milk instead of water.  
So, like I said... so far, so good.  Cheaper than buying the Starbucks latte bottles for me and quicker and easier for the wife when she wants a quick cup of java to go.",5

402,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/15/2021,"My wife and I are cold brew junkies.  We’ve tried every kind, including making our own.  Jot shocked us with how good it tasted… and we love being able to adjust our intensity, depending on the day/time.",5
403,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/15/2021,So fast to make coffee and it tastes great too!,5
404,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/15/2021,You seriously cannot mess up this coffee! It taste so good no matter what combination of milk/water/flavoring you put in with it. I love being able to make my own lattes at home without all of fancy equipment too. I’m going to ensure I keep the fridge stocked!,5
405,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/15/2021,I had been spoiled on a recent trip to Mexico with a cappuccino every morning at breakfast and I bought a frother and have been enjoying a cappuccino often since my Jot arrived.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!,5
406,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/15/2021,"Love love love. I didn’t want to buy another appliance or deal with recycling pods so Jot is an awesome time saving solution as a mom of 3 toddlers. The flavor has me craving a second cup right away, definitely my new jam.",5
407,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/15/2021,Nothing beats a real cup but the ease won me over.,4
408,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/15/2021,"I have been very pleasantly surprised by Jot (the regular and dark). It's oddly not acidic at all, very flavorful, and packs the right amount of caffeinated punch for a cup of coffee.",5
409,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/14/2021,"After getting quite a few ads for Jot, I was persuaded and SO HAPPY to be. The packaging is amazing and sustainable and then you get to the good stuff, the coffee. I was blown away such bold flavor could come from such a tiny bottle. Looking forward to including this in my daily routine and trying future flavor profiles.",5
410,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/14/2021,"I really enjoyed the chocolatey taste, but it was quite bitter when I mixed it with just water. Maybe I measured wrong, but it is super super good with almond milk!",4
411,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/14/2021,"I really enjoy this product, it saves me time and money!",5
412,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/14/2021,"I am an avid STRONG coffee drinker and this met all of my expectations. Mix it with a little milk, and it tastes just like you bought it from a cafe!",5
413,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/14/2021,"I have enjoyed the ease of use so far, but have not exactly found the taste that I love the most. The Original tastes quite bitter/dry for far. Perhaps I just need to play with proportions a little more to find the best. So still learning! I do love the mug I got though. Hoping this can be used best for my mid afternoon pick-me-up.",4
414,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/14/2021,Just wish there is a decaf option!,5
415,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/14/2021,Jot coffee makes it really easy to prepare a good coffee. I usually enjoy pour over coffee so I tried mixing with hot water - it was a-okay. Next day I tried making cold latte with oat milk and it was really good!  Now I drink Jot latte iced more often than my usual go-to pour over coffee in the morning!,5
416,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/14/2021,The flavor of the regular coffee is pretty good. I mix mine with a non-dairy milk.,5
417,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/14/2021,"First off, DELICIOUS and so easy to make. As a mom of two I needed a little pick me up and I hate hot coffee but brewing hot coffee then putting it over ice was gross and spending money at Starbucks just wasn’t ideal. I’m so happy I decided to try this out. My other half tried it too and his first sip he described it as “a slap in the face” haha mainly because his normal coffee is nothing compared to Jot. 10/10",5
418,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/14/2021,"This is ""just ok."" The (dark) coffee is very ""watered down"". Or maybe I hadn't realized how strong I like my coffee, until now. I haven't even tried the regular. Definitely not going to get this on subscription.",3
419,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/14/2021,I usually do pour overs or use an aeropress for coffee. They were great when working from home as I had time to do that. Now that I’m back to dropping off kids at school and going back to work I no longer have time to grind and brew. Starbucks tastes like burnt rubber and coffee shops are expensive so I’m glad I came across jot on instagram! It takes no time to make a greay cup coffee! A tablespoon (and a half) of jot and a little bit of agave syrup with hot water for the morning or with cold almond milk in the afternoon and I’m set. Amazing!,5
420,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/14/2021,"Jot has been great, I’ve had more energy and felt better since taking it. I have acid reflux and it doesn’t bother it at all, it tastes wonderful and is easy to make. It’s been a major upgrade to my life!",5
421,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/14/2021,Very enjoyable and fast to make!,5
422,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/14/2021,Super smooth coffee and really simple to make a delicious coffee and go! Such a great addition to my busy life as a nurse!,5

424,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/14/2021,The instruction and process is simple. The coffee is great!,5
425,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/14/2021,"I was unsure and a little skeptical at first, but every cup has been smooth and delicious! As a coffee ""snob"", I'm picky about the quality and acidity of my coffee. Jot is rich and flavorful, without the bitter acidic aftertaste.  I'm a huge fan!",5
426,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/14/2021,I had never tried a coffee concentrate before. I read all the great reviews and thought I’d give it a go. I am hooked! So good! So smooth. I will be a recurring customer!,5
427,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/14/2021,Easy to make a variety of custom drinks & tastes delicious. Excited to incorporate jot into my daily coffee routine!,5
428,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/14/2021,"I tried both origunal and dark. I tried them hot and iced. It is the Perfect Cup, no matter which...smooth, rich, balanced flavor that will not disappoint!",5
429,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/14/2021,Jot is amazing! Tastes great and saves me so much time before work! Definitely recommend Jot to all my friends and family!,5
430,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/14/2021,"I really appreciate a good iced coffee and I am completely satisfied. This coffee is smooth and sort of creamy somehow, kind of like a nitro cold brew. High recommend.",5
431,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/14/2021,Bought this coffee to have while fasting and absolutely loved it! Was so surprised by the smooth rich taste!,5
432,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/14/2021,"Meh just Meh. Was really excited for this to be one of my favorite things, underwhelmed. Kudos on the marketing.",3
433,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/14/2021,I use Jot along with Verb energy bars to keep we awake at work and they’ve been a lifesaver to me. They wake me up fast but don’t leave me jittery and shaky. Plus there’s no crash! Absolutely loving my Jot :) I put it in milk with ice and a splash of creamer and it’s like my own iced latte.,5
434,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/14/2021,This is seriously the best coffee I have ever had. Better than the mainstream coffee places like dunkin and starbucks. This coffee gives me energy and the freedom to make it however I want. And it tastes amazing.,5
435,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/14/2021,I was skeptical Jot would taste like my favorite iced coffee. So glad to be proven wrong! Jot is easy to use and tastes great!,5
436,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/14/2021,I am an avid coffee drinker and never thought I would change up my morning routine. Jot now makes my life so much easier and the flavor is amazing. It has a nice smooth taste and I only need one cup a day! I typically was consuming 2-3 cups a day. I will never turn away from Jot!,5
437,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/14/2021,I bought this for my husband to try and he loves it!,5
438,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/14/2021,Bold flavor and easy prep. I was so surprised how accurately a splash of Jot made a cappuccino. Instant auto ship.,5
439,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/14/2021,Even though my husband and I have different taste in coffee we both enjoy drinking Jot,4
440,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/14/2021,"Arguably some of the best black coffee I’ve ever had in my life. I can’t explain it, but it’s so good. Like, I’d rather have JOT than a lot of premium black brews from local shops around town. Premium standards meets exceptionally fast and simple. Just add 8-10oz hot water to 1Tbsp and it’s the perfect cup. Every 👏🏻 Single 👏🏻 Time.",5
441,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/14/2021,"Jot has saved my life. And my bank account. This is the only caffeine that has ever really had an affect on me and only in the BEST way. I was alert for hours and didn't need a nap for once. (Okay yes I usually take one anyway, but at least you know it won't keep you up if you don't want it to, right?) No jitters even after too many cups (which you will likely have because it's that good). I could never drink regular coffee, only espresso, because it was too acidic and well... watery/gross. This is better than any espresso I've ever had. I bought a milk frother and now lattes are practically instantaneous. It's a little dangerous. If they start selling flavored syrups, I'll never go anywhere else for my coffee needs. No one else could ever satisfy me like Jot ;)",5
442,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/14/2021,"Surprised me, but it is an excellent cold brew and I like that I can add in my own filtered water of choice. Very smooth, great taste.",5
443,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/14/2021,"I was a little skeptical at first having tried other brands that disappointed. But after trying the Jot original version (with milk), it was delicious! Just strong enough and not too sweet or bitter, just the perfect blend. Would definitely order more!",5
444,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/14/2021,Jot is perfect for me. I’m always short on time and space. Jot solves both and tastes amazing so I’m not compromising flavor for convenience. Thank you for an awesome product that delivers!,5
445,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/14/2021,I love how this simplifies my morning routine while still giving me the wake up I need. Love the dark flavor. I just wish I knew how much caffeine was in each tablespoon- the website does not seem to have this info!,4
446,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/14/2021,So much easier to make my iced coffee in the morning with Jot. The no prep work like hot coffee makes mornings before work so much faster and I love that I don't have huge cold brew containers taking up so much space in the fridge and then running out of it in 4 days. It's been a over a week and I still haven't finished a bottle.,5
447,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/13/2021,"For those who love the taste of a good cup of coffee, this is it. I hesitated because I thought nothing could taste as good as the hand-created cup I lovingly brew every morning. I was wrong. Jot has saved me SO much time, energy, and morning breakdowns. Quick, easy, delicious, and effective.",5
448,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/13/2021,"I was looking for an easy way to have coffee before work without having to wake up earlier. I literally wake up, add a tablespoon of the concentrate to a travel cup, add almond milk, and I'm good to go!

Definitely a purchase I will be repeating",5
449,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/13/2021,Loving the bold flavor and the ease of making an iced coffee that tastes great!,5
450,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/13/2021,This coffee is so good. I tried both original and dark both are fantastic with milk I don’t like jot as much with water but I will drink it. Over $6 for one coffee a day at the coffee shop. This stuff is worth it!! Customize it how you want … the ingredients are so simple. Thanks for a great coffee shop alternative Jot!,5
451,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/13/2021,"Coffee has always been a part of my morning routine. Jot is so simple and quick, it makes my mornings easier. The coffee is great, as good. If not better than your local coffee chains.",5
452,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/13/2021,I love this with oat milk!,5
453,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/13/2021,The best coffee concentrate I’ve ever had. It’s SO smooth. I dont usually like black coffee but I could drink this black everyday. It’s so good !,5

455,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/13/2021,Very tasty and super easy!,5

459,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/13/2021,"It’s very convenient and usually I just need a very small cup, which makes ultra coffee the perfect choice. Besides, I don’t need my coffee to be as strong as many other people, so a bottle can probably last at least twice as long for me.",5
460,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/13/2021,Better than Starbucks. So yummy and so simple.  I’m hooked.,5
461,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/13/2021,Idea of instant coffee but 100x tastier! The convenience of instant coffee but tastes like coffee shop.,5
462,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/13/2021,It was delicious. I was surprised by its flavor.,5
463,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/13/2021,"I'm a busy college student with a slight caffeine addiction. I hate dealing with coffee grounds, so Jot is the perfect coffee for my packed schedule. I just microwave water for 2 minutes, mix in a tablespoon of Jot, and I'm on my way. So easy, and it tastes incredible!",5
464,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/13/2021,"I was spending too much money at my local coffee shop weekly. While this coffee is smaller, I find I enjoy it more. I ration myself to one per day and only hit the coffee shop on the weekends. Tastes great, easy to make.",5
465,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/13/2021,"It’s so convenient but the flavor is not compromised! I also like that the high concentration allows you to make a version of a latte or a coffee, hot or iced. I was a little skeptical but decided to give Jot a try when they had the value set with two bottles of coffee and the tumbler (which I also really like). I definitely recommend Jot if you’re a regular coffee drinker. I’ve used it every day since it arrived and I’ve even told my fellow coffee-loving friends about it.",5
466,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/13/2021,"I've been trying to simplify my breakfast routine and Jot def comes in clutch. I just add hot water from my kettle, creamer, and Jot. Much better than instant coffee and much quicker than brewed.",5
467,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/13/2021,"I really loved the unique pure taste of the original coffee, I thought the dark roast was slightly bitter for my taste. The ease and convenience of this coffee makes it extra desirable, I’m impressed with it and I love that it’s organic.",4
468,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/13/2021,"zero after-taste or bitterness! mixed 1 tablespoon w a tiny bit of water, some coffee creamer and lots of ice, only one shot needed! really awesome",5
469,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/13/2021,I’m not a black coffee drinker but this is tasty enough to drink black! Loving it!,5
470,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/13/2021,I am obsessed! Hot coffee is the best tasting coffee I have ever had! It is smooth and bold without bitterness! And so easy to make a cup of great tasting coffee! I gave some to my BFF to try and she was instantly hooked!,5

472,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/13/2021,"I love being able to make quick and delicious coffee beverages before running out of the door in the mornings. I have tried both the Original and Dark blends and both are equally delicious. The recipe cards that Jot includes in the order are perfect for hanging on the fridge and don't add much time to the time it takes to make a serving of Jot. I wholeheartedly recommend Jot to anyone wanting to make quick, delicious coffee any time of day.",5
473,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/13/2021,"Jot is my.new coffee brand. It is bold but smooth, not bitter. I had almost given up on drinking coffee because of the heartburn I was experiencing from acidity of other coffees.",5
474,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/13/2021,"Very smooth and balanced, and good cold or hot. The flavor profile is more traditional roasty/caramel while I typically prefer more fruity/floral coffees, but I still enjoy it. Also great that it doesn’t take up much room in the fridge and is ready in a pinch.",5
475,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/13/2021,As easy as the ads say and it is great flavor. I haven’t tried it hot yet but I’m looking forward to trying it.,5
476,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/13/2021,Need to use more concentrate than expected to get a full 8 oz coffee flavor,3
477,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/13/2021,"So smooth, no bitterness, but lacks roasted flavor. We had the original and dark. Less water helps, but you don't get a full cup of coffee. We ended up having to put more of the concentrate and used it up a lot faster than we thought we would.

Normally we go to Peets to get whole roast beans and buy them 1/2 lb at a time and grind them fresh daily. JOT helped cut that down and we never had to worry about it going bitter. 

The packaging is cute and the mug is great",4
478,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/13/2021,Coffee is very smooth and delicious.  Ready to make and very tasty!!!,5

482,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/13/2021,"I did not think it would be possible to use 1 tablespoon of this stuff in 8 ounces of milk or water but not only is it possible but I could use even less than that. The taste is great. It’s very smooth. It’s so smooth, in fact, that I can get away with using barely any sugar at all. I highly recommend this.",5
483,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/13/2021,The coffee tastes great. It makes the best cold brew.,5
484,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/13/2021,"I tried Jot when I was testing all the different cold brew concentrates and got hooked off the quality.

Great stuff!",5
485,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/13/2021,Jot is great!  I bought two bottles (original and dark)for my wife for her birthday.

488,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/12/2021,"I ordered 2 bottles of Jot and they were delivered very quickly. They make the mornings easier when I am in a rush and don't have time to make hot coffee.  I know you can make it both hot or cold, but I prefer it cold with a little oat milk.

Also, getting a free travel mug with the order is also a great perk, and I love that the colors always change! 

This is definitely going to be a fridge staple from now on!",5
489,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/12/2021,"I love Jot! It's a wonderful way to start the day, or keep it going. Excited to order more!",4

491,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/11/2021,"The best of both worlds! I bought this for my husband who has to have at least 2 cups of coffee a day, and we both tried it - love it!  I would recommend to up it from 1 to 1.5-2 tbsp.  It is so easy and so quick, even on the run.  I would use to make cold brew, and also use K cups, but this takes seconds!",5
492,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/11/2021,I do like this product and find it very convenient however I can’t really afford it because the recommended ratio is to week in my opinion. I end up going through it much faster then my budget allows :/,3

495,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/11/2021,Love the coffee and the mug. The taste is similar to artisan coffee shop without traveling to one,5

500,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/10/2021,Surprisingly bold but very well balanced. No sour notes. I'm usually a dark blend drinker but I actually prefer this one.,5
501,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/10/2021,"I am a coffee snob and I previously worked as a barista, so I prefer to brew my own coffee because I can't stand the sour overbrewed taste. Jot concentrates don't have that, much to my surprise! The flavor of the concentrate is also very bold but balanced (dark moreso than original). I really enjoyed it.",5
502,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/10/2021,"I was skeptical about whether Jot would taste like good cold brew or watered down coffee. Much to my delight, it exceeded my expectations, and while it's cheaper to brew your own cold brew at home, the convenience can't be beat. It's become a part of my morning and afternoon routine, and I've signed up for a subscription for additional savings.",5
503,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/10/2021,Maybe too smooth for me? Luckily Jot now has a “Dark” version that o can’t wait to try!,5

Thank you for an excellent product!",5
510,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/10/2021,I saw the ad where this guy said he can can get his iced Vietnamese coffee in less than a couple minutes. I’ve been trying out different unsweetened ice coffee for the last 2 yrs. I’ve been disappointed multiple times but Jot is pretty good when I make ice coffee. It has a crisp and it’s tasty too not need for cream or milk.,5
511,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/10/2021,I got tired of the words after taste from other coffees like keurig and I hated the waste that comes with pods. Ordering coffee from Starbucks and coffee shops adds up pretty quickly and I am way too lazy to get up and brew my coffee every morning. Jot covers all these bases and tastes absolutely amazing! I've found the perfect coffee option and I'm never going back! I how that add more flavors soon!,5
512,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/09/2021,What a great service. Love the flavor. Hard to stop at one cup,5
513,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/09/2021,I really liked it as a cold brew! I made an awesome pumpkin cream cold brew with it!,4
514,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/09/2021,"The coffee is so quick and easy - I just add milk, water or creamer and on my way! Also tastes delicious and get to skip the coffee lines",5
515,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/09/2021,"This coffee is amazing! We love iced coffee and this makes it so easy to have a really good cup that's not watered down. It's so easy, taste like it's from a real coffee shop and just straight up the best. We will definitely be buying again!",5
516,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/09/2021,"I thought that Jot tasted great, and love the ease of making either ice, or hot coffee.  I tried the other brand, but did think that Jot tasted better.  I will be buying more.",5
517,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/09/2021,"I first bought this product cuz it shows how convenient it was also it was advertised everywhere 😆 but as soon as I tried it, my family tried it, we all fall in love with it !!! (And my wallet too 😉)
We love how we can basically mix it however we want, whenever we want and how strong we wanted.  It’s amazing!  
It’s on my gift list for all my friends and family for sure.",5
518,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/09/2021,Better than the dark which can run a little bitter. ,5
519,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/09/2021,"Great coffee taste, easy, convenient. Overall the best concentrate/cold brew type coffee I've had.",5
520,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/09/2021,Might be a little too much caffeine for me but the coffee itself is delicious and convenient!,5
521,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/09/2021,"My husband and I love Jot. We were feeling bad about using coffee pods and all the waste associated with them. Jot is delicious, super-convenient and we feel good about minimizing our waste stream.",5
522,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/09/2021,Honestly was hoping for fuller flavor it tastes slightly watered down. The main issue is the price - for it to taste good you really need 2 full spoons and that makes it pretty expensive.,3
523,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/09/2021,Yummy iced coffee,5
524,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/09/2021,I have never been able to make myself a good cup of iced coffee until Jot. This is truly a game changer. It is saving me a lot of money too!,5
525,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/09/2021,"I was apprehensive b/c of the premise of how this coffee works, but its actually amazing. It doesn't taste watered down, in fact it tastes just like regular cold brew. Would highly recommend everyone try it.",5
526,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/09/2021,I should’ve bought this a long time ago. Easiest way now to jumpstart my day. Not only does it taste bomb but I don’t have to worry about making coffee in the morning. Just one tablespoon mixed with my fave coffee creamer and boom I’m out the door!,5
527,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/09/2021,This coffee is super easy to prepare and so delicious.,5
528,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/09/2021,So glad this deliciousness is now in my mug.  I truly was missing out!,5
529,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/09/2021,My wife uses Jot to make her Iced Coffees and there really isn't a better Iced Coffee out there.,5
530,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/09/2021,"I am a nurse working 12 hour shifts. I drink one in the morning and take one with me in the ceramic leak proof tumbler. It truly is leak proof. I have ice in my coffee all day long. It is an amazing mid day pick me up than you need a little help making it through the day. I tried multiple different brands and trust me it was a waste of money. Jot is the coffee you want. It is not bitter and can be made to the type of coffee you like, not just cold. I will never go back to any other product. Try it and you will not be disappointed.",5
531,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/09/2021,"I loved my first shot at Jot, and we ordered again. Then I bought two bottles for friends who were drinking INSTANT COFFEE. Never again.",5
532,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/09/2021,I LOVE that I can make truly delicious ice coffee at home that is just as satisfying as coffee shop versions. The flavor is deep and there is no bitterness. And it takes up hardly any fridge space. Worth the money for sure!,5
533,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/09/2021,Pretty good....trying out new recipes now.,4
534,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/09/2021,Yum! ,5
535,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/09/2021,My first cup was amazing and I’ve not stopped since. I got my box off my porch at 8pm at night and my boyfriend asked me if I was making myself coffee at that time and I said “yes” I tried the fellow cup with it and I loved it so much! Milk and a tablespoon of jot and it was so creamy and rich! Already through 1 of the 2 original bottles I’ve gotten and it’s not been a week since I’ve revived it. Will definitely need more!!!,5
536,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/09/2021,"It’s very convenient and quick which is nice when I’m trying to get out the door but for flavor and taste I would still take the extra time to make a pour over. Having this with hot water really just doesn’t compare if you drink black coffee. If you’re adding a bunch of milk or sugar to this I can see how it would be better. Also this is pretty pricey $24 for 14 cups but you’re definitely paying for convenience. However, I can see myself keeping this on hand to make tiramisu and other baked goods",4
537,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/09/2021,"I love this coffee I keep one at work, and one at home!  So good!!",5
538,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/08/2021,"I’m always on the go and I like my coffee to be convenient, but this usually means sacrificing flavor. Jot is easy and delicious! I like to add it to milk with a little bit of flavor (vanilla soy milk and cinnamon brown sugar syrup make a cinnamon roll coffee, you won’t be disappointed). I’ve been drinking the ultra and it’s chocolatey and rich. I love it! It’s really upped my coffee game and now I don’t have to sacrifice flavor for convenience anymore!",5
539,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/08/2021,"I love the dark ultimate coffee, the flavor is amazing compared to some others I’ve tried. My only comment would be that it would be nice if the first shipment came with something to measure out the exact amount needed. Otherwise, everything is great! Especially love the packaging, very sleek.",5
540,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/08/2021,"Jot is just the pick me up I needed at noontime, the flavor is amazing. Love it!",5
541,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/08/2021,"This coffee is the best I have ever had.  I am definitely a snob when it comes to my coffee.  The flavor is bold and it leaves no after taste.  I have it in the over my warm milk and it rich, fragrant and yummy!",5
542,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/08/2021,Seriously didn’t know what to expect. I’ve tried concentrated coffee before and they have never really been my favorite but I loved the simplicity of Jot so I decided to give it a try! WOW am I glad I did! We love it and have already introduced our entire family to it! Will definitely be purchasing this regularly!!,5
543,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/08/2021,My girlfriend and I both love the taste and the convenience of the Ultra Coffee!,5
544,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/08/2021,"But in all seriousness, this coffee is easy and quick to make and doesn’t skimp on flavor either.",5
545,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/08/2021,"I had been looking for an alternative to regular drip coffee every morning, but wasn’t ready to invest in a fancy espresso machine yet.  I also didn’t want the waste that comes with “pods”.  Enter Jot!  I thought I’d give it a try, but now I can’t imagine going back.  I already stored my coffee maker in the basement.",5
546,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/08/2021,I LOVED it ! Strong smooth and easy to make in the morning when I’m in a rush !,5
547,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/08/2021,Addicted to this now :),5
548,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/08/2021,"I learned about Jot from Instagram and was intrigued about it when the person said that Jot didn't have the bitter taste that most coffee has. Turns out, it was the truth! Zero bitterness, and I love that! It's easy to make, and the taste is so good. I'm definitely a fan and will be ordering again!",5
549,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/08/2021,I have loved my coffee since first opening the jar! It is fast when trying to run around with kids but also smooth and good tasting! No more waiting in like ata coffee shop.,5
550,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/08/2021,Awesome coffee for someone who loves iced coffee. The taste is very rich and the concentrate lasts quite a while.,5
551,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/08/2021,My husband and I have both loved Jot so far!  It's so easy and super tasty!,5
552,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/08/2021,Jot is so flavorful and so easy to make a delicious cup of coffee! I’ve stopped going to Starbucks and my Nespresso Machine is collecting dust.,5
553,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/08/2021,"I enjoy the flavor/Organic aspect. I drink as a condensed cup of coffee by taking tablespoon. It is like a chilled Expresso.

Thank you!",5
554,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/08/2021,"Coffee is good, mostly ordered it for the free fellow mug...",3
555,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/08/2021,"i make lattes with oatmilk and the coffee has a really great taste. both the dark and original. and its super easy to use! i dont have lots of time in the day so i dont like to wait for a coffee or espresso to brew, and this is much better than the instant coffee powders i was using.",5
556,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/08/2021,I saw an ad for this and thought it would be cool to try - was blown away by the flavor when I had my first cup! In my opinion it tastes best cold - either black with just ice and water added or with milk is also great. This has been perfect on mornings when I’m in a rush and would normally stop by a coffee shop on my way - now I can just quickly make a cup of coffee with Jot!,5
557,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/08/2021,"The coffee is great just wish the hubby would have read the instructions and not used up all the coffee in 2 weeks ( 1/4 c per coffee cup? That explains alot of what was going on with him..lol!)  At that rate, I won't be able to afford the coffee. I loved how smooth it was and not bitter at the end. It is very versatile to either hot or cold.",5
558,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/08/2021,I truly love the taste and will continue to order so some time.,5
559,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/08/2021,I love the convenience and versatility of Jot! It is so easy to customize your coffee drink.. iced or hot. I add collagen and MCT oil and a little almond milk. It is so good! I also love my free to go cup. Thanks Jot!,5
560,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/07/2021,"I'm very picky with my coffee, but this met my expectations! I generally feel I have to buy my coffee daily for it to be good enough, but with this I can make it at home and enjoy it. Great for coffee lovers!",5
561,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/07/2021,Great flavor!  Epic boost of energy that will last all day!  And only one tblsp/day!   Tastes great in hot almond milk for a latte or with a full cup of cold water. It’s an  iced coffee that taste better than all of the drive through options.  You won’t be disappointed!,5
562,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/07/2021,"So quick and delicious. Saying goodbye to my bulky, time-wasting, pod machine!",5
563,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/07/2021,Jot is a convenient way to make either hot or cold coffee. The top of the bottle has a better design than another brand I tried - no mess or dripping to clean up. Will buy again.,5
564,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/07/2021,"I was really skeptical. Thought it would be bitter, and taste, for lack of a better word, old.

It was fantastic. Rich, smooth, just a great taste.

Buy it, y'all.",5
565,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/07/2021,"I had average expectations about Jot and decided to give it a shot after checking other reviews. Easy to say, I was blown away by my first cup - full, bold, and insanely smooth. Ready for another shipment as Jot is now part of my busy morning routine!",5
566,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/07/2021,"I was interested in trying this product bc I have little time in the mornings but am a coffee snob and want quality. My husband is a bigger snob than me. He loves it, which says a lot, and he stole my new cup too. I wouldn’t mind the taste being bolder, but that is a personal preference. I now use a bit less water to achieve my perfect latte.",4
567,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/07/2021,This is hands down worth every penny!,5
568,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/07/2021,I'm sooooo happy I decided to give this a try. It tastes BETTER than my brewed coffee! It's smooth and rich and delicious. I've already ordered more as a gift!,5
569,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/07/2021,I’ve never been much of a coffee drinker but Jot is quickly changing that. I almost exclusively drink iced coffee and having pre-made cold (essentially) espresso makes it so easy to get my coffee fix. Thanks Jot!,5
570,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/07/2021,"I love coffee. I spent plenty on making espresso at home for both convenience and cheaper than going out. Jot made is even simpler and will always compete with my fresh ground beans and espresso machine. I'll probably do half the time Jot and half fresh espresso. This says a lot on how good Jot is. For those coffee snobs out there: I'm just like you. I wouldn't have tried Jot either if it wasn't for the fact that I was gifted two bottles. I regret not trying it before. Don't make the same mistake
 and say least try it.",5

572,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/07/2021,"I wish I knew about Jot sooner! I’m guilty of going to Starbucks every morning to buy my cup of coffee, and I realized how ridiculously expensive that’s been. Also the time spent going there could be spent doing other things. So I’m glad I hear about Jot. It’s easy, inexpensive, but the taste and quality is there that it seems like I’m getting my coffee in a high end coffee shop. I love it!",5
573,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/07/2021,Even my super picky impossible to please 17 yo daughter loved it!,5
574,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/07/2021,Jot is extremely simple to use and lets you prepare coffee at home in less than 30 seconds. The iced coffee tastes just as good as cold brew from a coffee shop for a fraction of the cost.,5
575,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/07/2021,Enjoy your simple and easy nature this solution brings to a busy morning. Can make it hot or cold for on the go.,5

581,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/07/2021,"We have tried many versions of coffee of the years: regular drip machines, Keurig, Nespresso, French press, etc. Jot is definitely our preferred way of making coffee or coffee drinks now! It is so simple, quick, easy, and very good! Definitely worth trying, and we will be buying it again and again!",5
582,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/07/2021,Delicious coffee and so easy to make. There's really no excuse not to try this product. Sayonara Starbucks!!,5
583,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/07/2021,"I purchased this coffee looking for convenience and great taste.

It makes my coffee preparation in the morning before work so fast! I highly recommend this product!",5
584,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/07/2021,"I had my hesitations about this. I love iced coffee and am particular about it. This stuff is smooth, clean tasting. Not acidic at all. It’s definitely worth the hype!!",5

597,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/06/2021,"I really liked the coffee quality. The taste, smell, and consistency of the coffee was really good. I would just encourage people to not necessarily stick to the 1TS of coffee and just put as much as or as little as they like.",5

But after drinking jot I will not be going back!
I don’t need to add sugar anymore either. The taste is so perfect. Can’t wait for a decaf version to come out (if that is even possible to do).

605,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/06/2021,I like the taste of the coffee black but I feel like it’s a little weak tasting w current serving size. If i addd more concentrate I would blow through the bottle too quickly. I am someone who drinks ice coffee no cream so I am just used to strong coffee. I wouldn’t mind a bigger bottle option. I would recommend the product But may not be cost effective for me vs my current routine.,4

It doesn't hurt my belly! Making coffee in the morning doesn't take THAT long, but Jot is much more convenient.  If I'm running late to work, I just throw a bottle in my lunch box and make it when I get to work.  And then I don't have to drink breakroom coffee that upsets my belly.  And it's so easy to make iced coffee drinks than ever before.",5

620,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/06/2021,"When reading about this product one of the quotes I saw was coffee for people who need coffee to make coffee. That sums this product up nicely. It is quick, easy, and most importantly a great cup of coffee.",5
621,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/06/2021,"I’m a huge fan of convenience, which is why I typically opt for coffee pods when I’m on the go. I hadn’t thought there was an even more convenient option, let alone one with such a smooth taste. Jot provides a simple flavor without additives which is exactly the thing I’ve been looking for.",5
622,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/06/2021,This coffee is so delicious and I love how easy it is to make a good cup of coffee each morning! Definitely will be buying more!,5
623,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/06/2021,Love my coffee in the morning. But with 2 kids under 3 I don’t always get to go through my ritual. This has allowed me to have great coffee without effort. Love it!,5
624,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/06/2021,"I have been very pleased with Jot. It’s very simple to make and very quick so I’m never worried about not having time in the morning. The taste is very good with both light and dark blends.  Its very hard to not over due it and have like 10 cups a day of the stuff. 

Overall very pleased and highly recommend!",5
625,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/05/2021,"I really enjoy the smoothness of a good cold brew, and this did not disappoint. The recommended tablespoon was the perfect amount, producing a rich, smooth cup that still gave me that kick of caffeine I need in the morning.",5
626,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/05/2021,Smooth and my new cup of joy! ,5
627,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/05/2021,I was happily surprised with the smooth taste!! I have drank this iced and hot and love the taste both ways!! As a teacher I love that I can make this before work and during my break. I appreciate being able to buy a high quality product that helps women farmers and is better for the environment. I will be recommending this to everybody!! This product also saves me money and taste WAY better than Starbucks!!,5
628,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/05/2021,"So we're kinda coffee snobs. We would get whole beans shipped to us from Hawaii and grind them ourselves. Then we'd prepare coffee a number of ways (percolator, French press, espresso machine, etc). The problem is all that takes a lot of time and stuff.

I kept seeing ads for this stuff called Jot, and now we have a 1 year-old son. Free time being the precious commodity it is, I thought lets give this Jot stuff a try. Besides being a coffee snob I'm generally pretty skeptical, but will try new things, you never know what gems you'll find. 

I was blown away by this stuff! It really tastes great! I mean Kona Peaberry great! Aaaand it's so easy to make, I can mix it with so many more things and have it more often! I am so glad I took a chance on this stuff. So now I'm looking at cancelling our whole bean subscriptions and packing away some coffee tools (sorry Hawaii).

I hope this feedback gets back to all the folks at Jot because their attention to quality makes this something they should be very proud of. Can't wait to share this with friends and co-workers! Also, if you get adventurous and are able to, I'm just wondering how tasty a Kona sourced Jot would taste?",5
629,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/05/2021,"I liked it a lot as a cold drink. I like sweeter coffee, so I added almond milk and sugar free syrup. I tried it as a hot coffee and added creamer. I did not like that as much. I will stick to my regular hot coffee. I do like that it takes up less space than regular iced coffee or cold brew.",3
630,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/05/2021,This coffee is very delicious.  Follow the instructions on serving size and you’re golden.,5
631,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/05/2021,"I just love this coffee so much. Tastes amazing, it’s so quick and easy, and gives the boost I need. If I could be a brand ambassador for Jot, let me know how I could do it!",5
632,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/05/2021,First time ordering and I absolutely love this products as a cold brew with non dairy milk and ice. Two thumbs up!!!,5
633,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/05/2021,I went through the first bottle in about 3 days. Super good,5
634,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/05/2021,"I was hesitant to try Jot’s coffee but took advantage of their promo that came with free glasses. I was pleasantly surprised at how good Jot is! It’s better than coffee shop coffee, and way better than any coffee I can make at home. Not only does it taste great, but it’s so quick and easy to make! I’ve tried it both iced and hot and will definitely keep ordering.",5
635,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/05/2021,It’s really balanced… I was surprised at how good it tastes. I usually make my coffee with a French press daily. But this is great for iced coffee!,5
636,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/05/2021,This is by far the most convenient way to make coffee at home! I also feel like I have way more control over what the coffee will taste like since I'm not at the mercy of a machine and how it decides to make the coffee that day. Big fan and I will be a repeat customer!,5
637,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/05/2021,Amazing iced coffee I can make at home now! Definitely recommend!,5
638,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/05/2021,"So, so good. I love how easy Jot is and how delicious it is! Great flavor - I like to add a splash more than a tablespoon to give a richer flavor. 10/10 would recommend!",5
639,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/05/2021,"My go-to retail cold brew coffee gets discontinued during the winter months, so I was on the hunt for a year-round blend.  I love the convenience of just adding water and cream but still having a rich taste.  It’s great for the office and when I’m running late in the morning.  Plus, you can avoid the long lines at the coffee shops and get the taste you crave!",5
640,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/05/2021,Jot coffee is very good I’m still playing around with the amount to put in to have the perfect cup. I usually the black silk from folders. It’s so much easier in the morning especially since I leave before 5 a.m.I just signed up for the the regular kind to see which one I like better.,5
641,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/05/2021,"Delicious smooth brew. Much better than any other concentrate I have had. Very good with just some milk & ice. Good bye big brand, expensive coffee & waiting in line at 6 a.m.",5
642,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/05/2021,"I’ve tried another company’s coffee concentrate, and “mud” is the best description. So I was skeptical about trying another. I was pleasantly surprised at how good Jot coffee turned out to be. It’s fast, convenient, and stays good in the Fellow mug till my lunchtime mug, four hours later.
I’m pretty much a coffee snob, and I’m happy with this!",5
643,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/05/2021,"I’m a self proclaimed coffee snob so I was nervous about this, but wanted to have an option to take to work for an afternoon pick me up - I’m impressed! Taste is smooth, wakes me up and there is zero bitterness. I did one Tbsp with 6oz water, ice and a splash of half & half and it’s the perfect iced cold brew.",5
644,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/05/2021,"I've been wanting to use coffee concentrate lately, so I tried Javy and it was okay, not a huge fan. You guys came up as an add so I was like ""Might as well try another company"" And boy howdy am I glad I did. No heart burn, no weird taste, very strong. Jot is fantastic. I will be a customer for life now, this makes the most delicious coffee, like surprisingly great. So if you like easy AF iced coffee that actually tastes good, just buy this. Don't shop around, I already did and these guys win.",5

648,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/05/2021,"The advertisement popped up during a morning scroll session on instagram and my interest was piqued. I thought to myself it's worth a shot (no pun intended since it's literally a tablespoonful). It was far superior than the expectations I held. There is no need to pay $6 for a cold brew any more. I have recommended this product to colleagues and friends and will continue to do so! Kudos to the Jot team for making such a great product, well done!",5
649,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/05/2021,"This has made my mornings so much easier.  I just grab 8oz of water and toss a tablespoon in the cup, mix it up, and leave for work.  It tastes GREAT.  It’s the kick I need in the mornings to get going.  For flair, add a 3/4 of a tablespoon of condensed milk.  =D",5
650,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/05/2021,"I was so excited for my Jot bottles to arrive, that on the same day I tried the Dark and Original ultra coffee. It just pairs so well with any drink especially my matcha lattes. I love it!",5

666,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/04/2021,I was a bit skeptical of this but I thought I would give it a try because I want a fast one cup coffee I can take on the go or if I just rolled out of bed and in desperate need of a cup. It was so smooth and gives me the kickstart I needed. I love that I can have this in less than 3 mins and I’m a fan of smoother dark tastes. I recommend this for anyone even if you don’t the need convince of the quickness it just tastes good!,5
667,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/04/2021,Great product Even my mother loved it and she’s very picky,5

669,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/04/2021,I received the dark and regular roast and wow was I surprised by the quality and potency of the coffee. I mix in a little water and oatmilk and yum! One bottle lasts me 2-3 weeks depending on my usage. Definitely a keeper!,5
670,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/04/2021,"The coffee is really strong and saves a lot of time.  It's a little on the pricey side but compared to going out and buying a cup of coffee, this is obviously the cheaper solution.  Flavor is smooth and strong.  I definitely recommend and will continue to purchase.",5
671,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/04/2021,"I love this brand already! Only a week in and I’m obsessed. So quick to make every morning, and very delicious (the dark flavor is my fav). It was time to start saving money and stop buying the daily fast food coffee. This has become a LIFESAVER!",5

673,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/04/2021,"For my first Tablespoon of Jot, I decided to try making an iced latte using the recipe in the leaflet from the box, and it was amazing 🙌🏼 I felt like I had went to Starbucks and grabbed an iced mocha latte. Except with jot I’m able to make a months worth of iced lattes for what I spend on a weeks worth of Starbucks… + no more long waits at the pickup line.",5
674,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/04/2021,"There's nothing more convenient than being able to make my morning coffee in mere seconds! Jot is tasty, easy, convenient, all around excellent.

My only ""criticism"" is that it's easy to make your coffee overly strong because this concentrate is concentrated! So it's worth measuring your pour to avoid jitters.",5
675,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/04/2021,Great flavor,5
676,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/04/2021,"I saw so many reviews so had to try Jot for myself. I was skeptical when I ordered it thinking how good could a concentrate really be.

677,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/04/2021,"It is indeed tasty, and nice that it is so easy to make (especially in the sleepy pre-coffee morning!!).

694,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/03/2021,"My husband and I have long been coffee addicts and we love our triple shots over ice mixed with white chocolate and a splash of cream from the local shops… Combine the price and the fact we just moved somewhere new, and we needed an option in between buying our own espresso machine and our not quite strong enough homemade cold brew. And that’s when I stumbled on Jot  My husband and I have been enjoying it over ice with a little milk, cream, and simple syrup. Jot has a nice flavor, doesn’t seem to have a high acid profile, is super easy to make, takes up hardly any space, and doesn’t break the bank. Cheers to that!",5

700,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/02/2021,"Very tasty and very convenient.  Be sure to measure how much water / jot you're using the first couple times - I made it too weak at first.  I've got it down now, and I love it!",5

And the strength and flavor of the coffee isn't easily diluted by oat milk and/or creams. Very glad to have taken the chance on this coffee.",5
705,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/02/2021,I honestly love Jot and how quickly I can make my iced coffee in the morning and how easy it is. Just splash a few tablespoons in my number shake and I am ready to go for the day. I will definitely be a returning customer!,5
706,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/02/2021,"I'll split my review into three parts for the product itself, the value, and the packaging.

Product: Let me put this plainly - Jot is an incredible quality up of coffee with real balance in the flavor profile, smoothness, and all the rich caramel/chocolate notes you could wish for in your daily ""Joe"". It's super simple to enjoy, and ultimately super versatile to use in various concoctions. As someone who normally drinks cold brew for the reduced acid profile, I do wish Jot had a cold brew option that didn't agitate my GERD as much. The flavor of the classic Jot is very mild and palatable for most people, although I think I may enjoy the darker roast more next time - will update when I try it. I love that the concentrate doesn't lose any of it's flavor from a typical hydration/dehydration process.

Value: Jot is pretty expensive all things considered. Is it as pricey as a crafted brew from your local coffee shop? Nah. But it's certainly more than just getting coffee beans and making coffee. Sure, there's a price to pay for convenience, but I also would be willing to switch over to entirely Jot coffee if it were a bit more value for the money. A single bottle has around 14 servings in it, so if you drink a cup every day for a month, you're looking at around $36 for two bottles. That's still over a dollar per cup, but I digress.

Packaging: I really love the design of the bottle and the fact that it's glass and recyclable materials. The box was also beautiful and mostly uncoated brown cardboard, which was nice to know could also be recycled. My main concern was just how much packaging was involved for such a small bottle - I'd like to see less carbon footprint for this, as coffee is already a carbon-heavy production process even without the extra shipping to Jot and then to me, plus the concentration process, etc.

Overall, my first experience with Jot was excellent and I'm totally open to trying the dark roast option in the future. I look forward to my first cup of Jot every morning when I wake up now and really love the simplicity of preparing that rich, delicious cup of coffee.",5
707,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/02/2021,Saving my pocket money from getting an espresso machine and my daily stop to the nearest coffee store. Taste perfectly and you can do any drink with it!!!,5
708,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/02/2021,"Jot coffee was better than I expected!  I like my coffee strong (both in flavor and caffeine), and was skeptical that this concentrated blend could deliver the flavor I enjoy without having to use too much, but I was wrong!  The full body flavor is strong and smooth, not at all bitter or overwhelming and it’s easy to customize and tweak to your liking.  I prefer it with steamed milk - and I swear it tastes just as good, if not better, than a coffee shop cappuccino!  My husband actually said he wanted our Jot coffee over going out for coffee, and he’s never said that about ANY coffee we’ve made at home.  I will always have some Jot in our fridge!",5
709,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/02/2021,"I was a bit skeptical, but the convenience was alluring. I enjoy this product's simplicity and the delicious iced coffee flavor. The thermos is the perfect size to fit in my car's cup holder and keeps the ice for my coffee cold all day (I can even refill without having all of the ice melt).",5
710,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/02/2021,I was kinda skeptical at first when I heard about this coffee but I tell you what it is everything and more the dark is definitely my favorite I am going to be buying my family some for Christmas so they can fall in love with it like I did!!,5

712,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/02/2021,I spend nearly $6 per day visiting the coffee shop. I have tried to match quality at home for quite sometime…to no avail. I ordered Jot and was blown away by the ease and quality. The flavor is robust and hearty with no acidity like home brewed coffee. I mix my tablespoon with half and half along with a flavored syrup. I have gotten a lot of my friends hooked on Jot now. It really is worth it!,5
713,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/01/2021,"Not bitter. Tastes great. I'm quite happy with my purchase! I wasn't sure I'd like the dark, but it's great. ",5

It's quite good! I've been drinking iced lattes all week with the occasional hot cup. There is almost none of the bitterness that is present in regular coffee and/or espresso. The regular Jot is downright smooth.

I'm already looking at placing a second order.",5

I love the flavor and how easy it is, especially for ice coffee where it's ready to go. The packaging is great and I love that it came with a seasonal recipe card for drinks to try. I'll definitely be ordering more or might even subscribe so I don't run out!",5
718,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/01/2021,Love the taste and the extra flavor is so good. I enjoy it very much. I will be ordering more.,5
719,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/01/2021,"I’m a digital nomad that travels frequently, and there is almost nothing worse for me than hotel lobby coffee.  With Jot, I can quickly make myself a reliably tasty cup of coffee without needing to boil water or carry any equipment.  I order a bottle before every trip - such a game changer!",5
720,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/01/2021,Great taste and makes my morning very easy!,5

726,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/01/2021,"I am very impressed with how good Jot coffee tastes! I purchased both the regular and dark, and both are very tasty! The dark is my favorite, but I’ve always been a fan of the “dark” roasts/blends. The Jot coffee container/cup is also great! It keeps my drinks super cool (and hot) for a long time! I definitely recommend this brand!",5
727,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/01/2021,"Solid product with good taste alongside convenience. Added a little extra to get the desired flavor, more so when using for hot vs cold coffee. All in all, A+. I plan to keep it handy for when I’m between cold brew batches…",4
728,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/01/2021,"I ordered this on a whim without any real expectation of what it would be and I think it may have replaced my morning ice coffee altogether.  The taste is fantastic (I do half oat milk, half water and a little agave) and it's just  so convenient - I no longer have to go thru the process of brewing my coffee and then waiting for it to cool down.  This is hassle-free and delicious.",5
729,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/01/2021,By far the best coffee you can get in the mail that I’ve found! Just a teaspoon of Jot and the rest milk and you have a delicious morning cup.,5
730,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/01/2021,"I needed something to make at home that would give me the same mid day boost as an iced coffee from a coffee shop and this does it for me! I love how easy it is to make, how good it tastes, and how it doesn’t take up much space in the fridge. My husband is now hooked too! Will definitely be ordering more.",5

733,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/01/2021,I’m sure it’s great hot and over ice cream but it’s definitely great with TJ’s almond/cashew/macadamia nut beverage for iced coffee.  For now I’m sold!,5
734,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/01/2021,Best iced coffee I’ve ever made at home. Family loves it. I will be ordering more.,5

736,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/01/2021,Tastes clean and well balanced. I’m surprised by the quality and simplicity of this brand. I feel like I’m drinking coffee straight from a cafe. Highly recommend!,5
737,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/01/2021,"The coffee is delicious and super convenient, but I gave it only 4 stars because it does leave a funny taste in my mouth. I'm still trying to find the right sweetener to add to it.",4
738,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/01/2021,"I enjoy making my own cold brew coffee at home because I can make it as strong as I like. However when fall/winter hits sometimes I crave that warm cappuccino or latte. I have forgone the huge espresso machine at home (had one and cumbersome to clean and took a lil time to make) and haven't yet tried those travel espresso presses. Now I don't need to, hello Jot Dark! I have tried this for a week now in variations- cold brew, latte, cappuccino. I am not disappointed and I hope you won't be either! Additionally, that lil travel Fellows topo mug promo is awesome! My first one came broken (seal came off lid). The team was great and sent me a replacement. Look forward 
to taking Jot camping with me as well! 1 tablespoon is all it took!",5
739,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/01/2021,"Love the flavor, and so easy to use, whether it's a hot cup first thing in the morning, or an extra cold brew pick-me-up later in the day.  Simply awesome.",5

742,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/01/2021,Was a little skeptic at first. Thought how does this bottled liquid make great coffee. After my first taste all I could say was “wow”. No bitterness super smooth delicious coffee. I actually took another drink looking for a processed like bitterness. I found none. Get this coffee you will not be disappointed.,5
743,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/01/2021,"Since WFH started, my fiancee started taking up coffee drinking as part of her morning routine. However, she seems to always get her preferred ratios of milk/cream and sugar right. So, she always ends up drinking less than a quarter of her mug, and admittedly, the whole coffee thing was more of ""just something to do"" besides log in first thing in the morning. But, she took the bite on an IG ad (thanks to @TheCrunchBros!) and since then, she's enjoyed EVERY combination of coffee she's tried. We've shared it with our in-laws and now we're both on a subscription service. The first time we ran out of coffee, I was *bummed* and couldn't wait for our next box. Now, we look forward to telling everyone else we know about Jot, and will likely buy a few boxes as gifts for people over the holidays!",5

745,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/01/2021,"As an iced coffee enthusiast, this concentrate tastes delicious! I’ve been looking for a new morning coffee ritual that doesn’t involve ordering delivery iced lattes or cold brews and this has become my morning go-to. I’ve tried other cold brew options that were way too bitter but this has the perfect smoothness with just the right touch of coffee bitterness. I’ll be drinking this as long as you still make it!",5
746,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/01/2021,Yummy 😋 ,5
747,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/01/2021,I can’t believe how good this coffee tastes without any added sweetener. I only add my almond milk and it tastes amazing. So glad I made this purchase. Niow instead of spending on ⭐️bucks everyday I’m saving big bucks. Thanks Jot!,5
748,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/01/2021,The original and dark are very smooth. I prefer the dark because it’s stronger. I love it!!,5
749,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/01/2021,The flavor is great and I love how quick and convenient it is to make. I’m going to get a couple bottles for my teacher husband to keep at school for quick pick me ups!,5

757,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/01/2021,"I will admit that I was skeptical upon ordering this that it wasn't going to be very good and definitely wasn't going to be worth the price that is being asked for it.

But I am here to tell you that I was wrong. It is amazing. One tablespoon, some cold water, a couple ice cubes and some cream and sugar to taste and WOW! I drank so much of it the first day, I am probably going to run out before my next order gets here.

I never write reviews, trust me. If you are on the fence because of the price, just do it. It is the best coffee I have ever tasted!",5
758,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,11/01/2021,I’m very happy with this coffee. I like iced coffee in the mornings and always running behind to make a decent cup. This helps me get the jump start to my day and it takes little to no time to prepare. I like so much I am buying again.,5

764,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/31/2021,"I was on the fence about ordering Jot. I didn’t want to just give into the ‘influence’. But my sister got some and I was able to get a taste of it. Hands down, rivals coffee I’ve tried in Europe. So delicious!",5
765,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/31/2021,I bought some for my coffee addicted husband. He works so hard and we have two kids he comes home to . He went from six cups a day to just one cup of Jot with a tablespoon and a half to get him through the day. I enjoy it as well and helps me keep up with the kids all day without crashing. We really enjoy the flavor and are looking forward to trying out more recipes with Jot!,5

770,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/31/2021,"I was skeptical at first as I am a big fresh coffee believer. After seeing this ad appear on Instagram and a friends recommendation, I decided to give it a try. It said it was organic and was native to the south/Central American region. I was completely blown away when I received the product and tried it. The glass bottle is the only way this type of coffee because it’s good! Glass is also better for health and taste reasons! Will be a returning customer!",5
771,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/31/2021,My favorite is the original. Have tried it both cold and hot and it is great! I even added it to my chocolate protein shake for a boost. The service was really fast too!,5

795,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/30/2021,"My son introduced me to JOT after he bought a bottle of each flavor, and a slick insulate cup, through an offer he’d received. I decided to try it as I have a deep ongoing taste for iced coffee all year. I have experimented with many sources, formulations, and concentrations. I have to say that JOT is efficient, tasty and easy to mix after just a bit of testing with amounts. And it stores so easily in the fridge that is already full of other things. Thank you.",5
796,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/30/2021,I could not be happier with this coffee! I make an iced latte with caramel and it takes a matter of 2 minutes!!! It has been a lifesaver with 3 kids! Not to mention it is the only coffee I actually finish right away! It tastes amazing ( a dark roast girl)! I will be purchasing again for sure!,5
797,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/30/2021,Really good tasting coffee and so much easier than using a machine at home!,5
798,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/30/2021,I really love Jot for the affordability and easy of use. It has stopped me from grabbing coffee at the place near my work several times already. And the flavor isn't my favorite but it is good coffee!,4

801,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/30/2021,Jot has changed my morning routine. Not only is it convenient it tastes great. I make it with a little water and oat milk and get a wonderful taste with some chocolatey notes.,5
802,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/30/2021,"I didn't have a high bar but wanted to try a different kind of ""instant coffee"" -- but this is pretty awesome. I expect coffee that isn't from a small roaster to be too darkly roasted and soured, like starbucks or nespresso. But both types of bottles I got have been very easy to drink. I enjoy making it a strong macchiato or cappuccino with homemade simple syrups to make flavored milk, but with plain milk it's good, and I had some with just hot water and it was good. I haven't tried it iced yet, but I'm sure that'll be great .I think next I'll do a dirty chai latte too.",5
803,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/30/2021,I absolutely love this coffee! The flavor is amazing- not bitter at all- and the convenience is even better with minimal waste! Thank you for your product- I’m hooked!,5

To me the taste is great. I love the fact that I can pretty much mix it with anything I want. Water, almond milk, oat milk, fancy coffee creamers etc. Hot or cold, it is up to you.

I will definitely order more in the future but the 2 bottles I got should last me a while.",5

I am not good at keeping that machine clean, so I just don’t. And I’m certainly not forking over $6 a day for one. I have however had a latte every morning this week because I can make one in less that 30 seconds that’s both delicious and espresso grounds mess free! Just some vanilla almond milk and Jot and I’m good to go. I think I have joined the coffee addiction community, happy to be here!",5

823,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/30/2021,"Jot is my favorite way to start my day. It's delicious, easy to make a drink with, and it stores nicely in my mini fridge in my studio. The small bottles are much better for the environment than the larger plastic bottles of iced coffee I had been buying. 
I like to mix Jot with creamy oat milk, regular water, or sparkling water.  It is good iced and also with steamed milk. I look forward to each delivery and as a picky coffee drinker I am very pleased to have found such a delicious coffee!",5
824,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/30/2021,Love the topography mug-perfect for coffee on the go!  Both the dark and original did not disappoint!  Love how it’s essentially instant coffee in the sense that you literally just add water and don’t have to spend a lot of time waiting for it to brew.  Have done iced and hot and both are great to drink without having to add any cream or sugar!  Great for those in the fasting world that want to extend the fast with black coffee!,5
825,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/30/2021,"I love a good sweet iced latte, but honestly it's been breaking the bank going to coffee shops regularly. I could never quite get the same taste at home, especially along with the convenience. Jot tastes soo much better than the instant coffee I would often make when I didn't order out, and honestly even better than the coffee I was buying!! And it's SO easy. A tablespoon of Jot, 8 ounces of oat milk, and a few pumps of a flavored syrup and I've got a delicious iced latte in just a few minutes (and I'm saving money!)",5
826,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/30/2021,I never thought i could make my own iced coffee at home as good as the one I can make using my jot coffee. I highly recommended it to everyone who loves iced coffee!,5

I just can’t do the coffee maker coffee, and the store bought pre made stuff wasn’t doing it for me either. Jot turns out to be way cheaper than most options, and it’s so. Good. I never write reviews but I had to for this. I mix one tbsp with 8oz cold water and a little creamer, and it’s perfect every time. I’m never going back.",5
829,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/29/2021,I was skeptical that Jot could actually taste like coffee. But it’s really good. I mix it with milk and drink it cold—as smooth as any cold brew I have had and dead easy.,5
830,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/29/2021,Super quick and easy way to drink iced coffee in the morning. I use way less sugar because of how tasty it is too!,5
831,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/29/2021,"I was skeptical that Jot could be that good, but I absolutely love this coffee concentrate! It is so versatile, and I have yet to be disappointed by a creation with this product!",5
832,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/29/2021,So far I've been very happy overall with the Jot products I've received.  it's very easy and pretty tasty.  I'm loving the Dark brew.  It's got a great flavor.  The Original brew....just tastes like pure bitterness unfortunately.  Maybe it was a bad batch?,4
833,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/29/2021,"My husband and I love it. This is our coffee, we don’t share this with our 4 teenagers. Step off my jot !!",5
834,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/29/2021,"I love this stuff. It’s so easy to make a morning coffee. I have a choice between tea and coffee and lately I’ve been choosing Jot! There’s a really awesome mug I got with the Jot bottles I got - it’s the metal thermal mug with a lid and a little spill preventing insert. It says it’s dishwasher safe, and it is, but my dishwasher left little lighter spots on the black coating. So now I have gray spots on my really great mug. So fair warning - AMAZING cup of coffee in my hand wash preferred mug.",5
835,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/29/2021,"I wanted to try out Jot simply for the convenience factor. However, I recently started roasting my own coffee which basically ruined everything else for me. I was skeptical that this would be any different. It was. This coffee is delicious hot or cold. I'm drinking it every day I work now, because the convenience is impossible to deny, but also because the taste is incredible. The bottles are small, but last way longer than you'd expect them to. What a relief that is. I'm pretty sure the next shipment will show up right as I'm finishing these off.",5
836,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/29/2021,"I don’t think there’s any other iced coffee brand or drink I’ve tried that matches the quality and flavor of this one. I’m very impressed, this is a high-quality brew, maybe the best one out there right now.",5
837,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/29/2021,Great product but customer service needs work.,4
838,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/29/2021,"Love the dark coffee, it is really good with ice or hot water and nothing else. Absolutely delish!",5

841,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/28/2021,I look forward to my morning coffee with Jot! Makes it so easy every morning! Tastes so fresh! I’m a convert! Got my husband and teen addicted as well!,5
842,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/28/2021,Just recently purchased Jot and am extremely pleased. Hot or cold it makes the perfect coffee! It doesn’t taste too acidic or burnt. And the bottles are super cute and are great for propagating plants when you are done,5
843,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/28/2021,"So easy to prepare iced lattes and most importantly so delicious. I was tired of spending so much on iced lattes, and I did not want to purchase an espresso machine. Jot came to the rescue!",5
844,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/28/2021,I am a coffee connoisseur and this coffee is one of the best tasting I have ever had. Having a quick way to make delicious coffee in the morning with a toddler has been amazing! Highly recommend Jot to any one that wants delicious coffee that is super easy to make :),5
845,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/28/2021,"Honestly, I was pretty skeptical at first since I first saw Jot marketed on social media, but after seeing the positive reviews online and on youtube, I decided to give it a shot. I'm really glad I did as it's honestly really good coffee and the price is really fair for how long the bottles last. I've had a few friends try it and they all think it tastes good.",5
846,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/28/2021,"I've fully converted my family and friends! It's so easy and delicious to make each morning. Needless to say we're hooked and well caffeinated in Austin, Texas!",5
847,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/28/2021,Excellent first cup! I talked a few friends into ordering too!,5
848,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/28/2021,Great coffee. It’s not to strong as I expected. Very smooth. I will definitely buy this again.,5
849,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/28/2021,"I’m really happy I gave the coffee a shot! I drink coffee everyday, sometimes more than twice 😅.  I’ve worked as a barista in multiple shops from coffee bean to intelligentsia. And I’ve tried other coffee concentrates from stores like Trader Joe’s and the taste wasn’t there, not satisfying, it was more to get my fix. When I made my Joy iced coffee as directed, I was surprised to have something taste like an iced coffee from a coffee shop. Now I don’t have to go out of my way to buy a coffee. I have it right at home! I’ve ordered a few more bottles. I’m considering subscribing.",5
850,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/28/2021,It’s easy and convenient and actually a delicious cup of coffee. Impressive!,5
851,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/28/2021,Well from the first cup it was truly amazing and smooth and yummy I drink it everyday the flavor is so rich I love the tumbler mug it is perfect for hot or cold love it I will never buy coffee from drive through again and no need to use coffee pot or Kurig again Jot is my coffee go to,5
852,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/28/2021,"Both flavors are excellent, it's hard to figure out which I like more.",5
853,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/28/2021,"I go through coffee pretty quickly and the stuff I bought in the store always had that ""bottled"" taste to it. Jot came pretty quickly, lasts a while, and tastes great. I'm really glad I tried it out.",5
854,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/28/2021,I love how simple the process is for making coffee. I love that I need very little of the concentrate and finally the dark and regular roast is very yummy.,5
855,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/28/2021,"I absolutely LOVE Jot especially the dark one, even for my sister hooked on it. I drink it every single day and it’s just delicious. I’ve partnered with them as a blogger too because it’s something I 100% believe in and value. Bring it to Target y’all will **** it. 😍😍😍😍😍😍",5
856,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/27/2021,Love the coffee and it's super easy and convenient!  Having fun playing around with the ratios as well to adjust the strength.  Highly recommend!,5
857,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/27/2021,Amazing ,5
858,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/27/2021,Coffee tastes great without having to worry about the acidity in it. Heartburn can really mess up things you love like coffee but you don’t have to worry about that with jot,5
859,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/27/2021,"I love my coffee! I usually only drink freshly ground and was surprised on how good Jot was. The dark is definitely my favorite. Also had a minor issue with an order and customer service is one of the most responsive that I've dealt with. Great coffee, great company!",5
860,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/27/2021,"When I ordered my first two bottles, it was without a doubt an impulse purchase and my expectations weren’t that high. But, after my first sip, I was genuinely caught off guard by how good the product was! My only regret is not subscribing right away.",5
861,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/27/2021,"Although I was initially hesitant based on whether this would be a worthwhile purchase, Jot has not only saved me time but money as well. A tablespoon and some hot water and I’m out the door ready for the day! Afternoon pick me up with some almond milk saves me a trip to the barista and I’m pretty sure there are more options available to me with less cost too!",5
862,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/27/2021,Making a Jot coffee is my new go-to morning coffee ritual! It's so convenient and tastes like it was made in a primo coffee shop! I don't know if I'll ever go back to any other method of making coffee at home. Life changing for sure!,5
863,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/27/2021,That's a fine cup of coffee...a real jolt! Smooth and delicious 😋,5
864,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/27/2021,I absolutely love this coffee. It so rich and smooth no matter how you prepare it. I’ve been doing lattes and iced coffee mostly and it is just perfect! I even tried it black and there is zero bitterness!!,5
865,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/27/2021,"I love coffee... But I rarely have time to make it, and even when I do have the time, I don't want a whole pot (I'm not a fan of single-serve machines). I've gotten into the habit of going to Starbucks once or twice a day, and that gets expensive fast, not to mention the amount of plastic waste it contributes to from all those cold brew cups.... So when I saw Jot, I thought it was worth a try. Now it takes me no time at all to make the perfect amount of coffee, I get to add the amount of creamer I like, and it's so much more sustainable.... All with the added benefit of being WAY less expensive! I do miss the employees at my local Starbucks, but all in all, I'm a happy customer so far!",5
866,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/27/2021,"Quick and easy, and makes a great cup of coffee.",5
867,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/27/2021,I HAVE THIS EVERY MORNING AND I LOVE IT!!! THIS IS A MUST BUY!,5
868,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/27/2021,I hate waking up in the morning and JOT seems to know that. I never have time to run my coffee pot or even my KUERIG. With jot its ice water then JOT!! I have managed to have coffee every morning since it arrived. Not only is it easy but the flavored is great!! I had no idea about this type of coffee and was skeptical but I am beyond glad I tried it and I will be customer for life!,5
869,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/27/2021,Awesome. Simply that. ,5
870,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/27/2021,Easy to make. Was pleasantly surprised that it was the right coffee “taste.” It wasn’t overwhelming or watered down. Excited to have discovered Jot.,5
871,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/27/2021,"I kept seeing jot all over Instagram and finally gave into the ads once I realized I needed more coffee. I am incredibly grateful that I did because Jot is amazing. So easy to make and it tastes fantastic. I’m not typically a dark coffee drinker, but both the original and dark flavors are excellent, I highly recommend this coffee!",5
872,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/27/2021,"Truth be told, I had a low bar for Jot. I figured there would be some loss of flavor. But wow! Was I wrong! Great vibrant flavor! Subtle tones and a fragrant aroma! And best of all, no bitter after taste. A really great cup of coffee hot or cold....",5
873,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/27/2021,It taste great and has been so convenient to keep on hand!,5
874,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/27/2021,"I was fully expecting to be disappointed, because I’m a coffee snob for sure, with my nose firmly stuck straight up in the air. But Jot ticked all my boxes!  Full flavored, strong yet smooth (even the regular!). Admittedly, I’m using 2 Tbsp Jot per 12 oz, but still. It’s plenty yummy. My fave recipe is Picnik Keto Creamer, Crushed Ice and Water with 2 Tbsp Jot in that awesome free mug they sent me, and I’m gtg. The mug was hella cool btw! Anyway thanks Jot - I’m sold!",5
875,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/27/2021,"I really enjoy coffee in every iteration.
I decided to give Jot a try and it did not disappoint. 
Its full of flavor and I have been experimenting with different blends and strengths, seems there is no wrong way to make this unique each time and have a great tasting drink. Hot or cold doesn't matter, this is great, will definitely keep this handy.",5
876,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/27/2021,I just mixed a TBSP with some whole milk and a little sugar… DELICIOUS!!! Way better than brewed coffee. I’ll definitely be ordering more!!,5
877,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/27/2021,Im a nurse and i work 7am to 3pm. Every morning i pass by a cafe to get iced coffee. Now that i have jot..Plus a free mug which is so nice! wow its just the perfect thing for someone like me! I now make my own iced coffee in the morning. I love the fact that im using coffee thats concentrated so i only need 1 tbsp and the rest is easy peasy. Thank you jot!,5
878,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/27/2021,Love how easy this concentrate is to use! I don’t give myself much time in the morning to make coffee so being able to mix my concentrate with milk is the best! I hate hot coffee so the fact that this is perfect for iced coffee is the best!,5
879,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original (Trial),10/27/2021,I think it's OK but I really thought it would be a lot more flavorful. I'm an espresso drinker and enjoy various Italian brands. I thought this would rank up there with them but it really did not.,3
880,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/27/2021,"This coffee is great and extremely easy to prepare. Even though it's concentrated, quality is not compromised at all! Highly recommended!",5
881,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/27/2021,"I’ve been looking for a good, quick at home coffee option since my daughter was born two months ago and tried this on a whim after seeing an ad. 
Coffee is smooth, delicious and provides the desperately needed kick to keep me going after sleepless nights.",5
882,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/26/2021,I was skeptical about the tast of bottled coffee. I was so impressed with the smooth flavor. I have tons of different flavors and brands of K-Cups to go with my whimsical flavor moods. This tasted smoother than alot of them. It was the easiest and quickest way to make an iced coffee and get out the door for work. Way to go! So impressed!,5
883,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/26/2021,I love making all my favorite coffee in less than a minute. The flavor is very clean and it doesn’t have the sour notes when hot or cold. I love it!,5
884,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/26/2021,"I was skeptical but I love the great coffee flavor with none of the bitterness I sometimes get with my french press. Plus, you know you’re getting that same awesome flavor every cup. Definitely going to be a repeat customer.",5
885,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/26/2021,"I have to say..I was skeptical at first. However, after one month I can confidently say that Jot lives up to the hype and is worth the money, especially for iced coffee/lattes. I can make my favorite iced lattes at home at a fraction of the price. My boyfriend and I have even been bargaining over who gets the last Jot when we get to the end of the bottle. I will be doing the subscription.",5
886,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/26/2021,"I definitely love a nice iced latte in the morning but I hate the process of waiting for it to cool down. I definitely love the easy and convenience of Jot Coffee. It took me a while to get the perfect ratio down but I prefer to have Jot as 1 tablespoon to 4oz of water, add 2 teaspoons of brown sugar, a dash of Vietnamese cinnamon, shake with ice, stir in about another 3oz of oat milk. Viola, enjoy!",5
887,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/26/2021,"I had ordered the regular and dark bundle.  I enjoyed drinking both flavors over ice and loved the smooth and not bitter taste.  While I do like the coffee, I couldn't find an expiration date on the bottles and made me wonder how old the coffee was since it's been bottled.  And especially when it wasn't stored refrigerated.  I've purchased other glass bottled, organic coffee from local markets before and I remember still seeing an expiration date.  If you could let me know where to find that perhaps, I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks.",4
888,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/26/2021,"You know how you go to a coffee shop for that pick-me-up in the middle of the day? You take a few sips, but then abandon your drink because you only got it to make yourself feel a bit better. With Jot, I can make that coffee drink at home! It tastes great, and I actually finish it. Plus, unlike the coffee shop, I don't mess up my own order.",5
889,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/26/2021,"My wife saw an add on Instragram for Jot and sent it my way. I was weary at first, but I am so glad that I tried it. Both the Dark and regular mix are fantastic and I drink one or two cups every morning cold brew style. I am hooked, about to order my second order now and going to go ahead and subscribe moving forward.",5
890,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/26/2021,"I was skeptical at first but JOT will turn you into your very own Barista without the need to spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars on expensive equipment. The coffee is robust, smooth, and ultra convenient. I love how I can quickly make an iced or hot coffee beverage on the go. My tastebuds are very happy.",5
891,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/26/2021,I bought this to try as a quick alternative when I forget to wash my coffee maker or I’m running late. I have not found a way to make it to my liking. It always ends up being watered down or not enough flavor. Are there any recipes I could try?,3
892,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/26/2021,Tried Jot after seeing an ad in Insta….. I’m so glad I did. I love cold brew and iced coffee. Jot is better than cold brew! My husband likes hot coffee. He also loves Jot and said the dark roast is the smoothest coffee he has ever had. Will definitely buy again. Can’t wait to do something with the empty glass bottles.,5
893,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/26/2021,Finally a concentrated coffee that tastes like legitimate coffee. I grew up with Cuban cafecito and this is near to perfection example of it. I added condensed milk and it was heavenly. Love it thank you JOT!!!,5
894,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/26/2021,Love it can make it as strong as I like and still taste good,5
895,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/26/2021,Awesome burst of energy in such a small amount of coffee!!,5
896,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/26/2021,"This has become my go to drink, I normally buy cold brew of expresso blend and Jot hit the spot when it comes to simplicity. I perfere the dark flavor but the original is good to, taste like a blonde medium mix and not acidic at all.",5
897,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/26/2021,"I normally buy pre-made cold brew from a local coffee shop cause of its bold flavor of expresso blend. Jot has a similar flavor for the bold, personally the regular was to light on the flavor side,  making my morning cold brew is super simple and the fact that my order came with a Fellow tumbler was the icing on the cake. If you are looking for a strong flavor definitely go for the bold,  if a mellower light flavor is your thing than the regular will do. Jot definitely has me hooked and the glass containers make great up-cycled vases for my wife's various plants throughout the house.",5
898,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/26/2021,I love iced coffee. I kept my expectations low for this product. When I received it in the mail… Great presentation. Great packaging. Great look of the bottle! I love that the directions are printed on the bottle. Even better was how it tasted! Not bitter at all. Very tasty! I usually like a bit of sugar in my coffee but I didn’t feel I needed it! I will definitely be ordering more when this runs out.,5
899,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/26/2021,I love how convenient it is to make an amazing cup of coffee. I'm an owner/operator of an automotive detailing company. I often work long hours and there is nothing better than having an awesome boost during the day.,5
900,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/26/2021,"I’m never going back!! Both the original and the dark make the best homemade iced coffee I’ve ever tried. I’d pick this over ⭐️💲any day!! It gives me great energy and keeps me going throughout the day.  I’ve tried it with water and with milk, even added a touch of creamer.  Yummmm.",5

902,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/26/2021,"I love how simple my morning routine is, thanks to Jot. I’ve wanted to cut down on how many cups of coffee I drink, make, and waste. Jot gives me the perfect cup with the perfect amount of caffeine in one take! No more pots of stale, overheated coffee. No more grinding, measuring, and setting timers. I simply fill my electric kettle with filtered water, and pour the hot water over one and a half tablespoons of Jot and like magic, and under 3 minutes, I’ve got the perfect cup and only cup I need to start my day!
Thanks Jot!",5
903,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/26/2021,"I am so happy to have smooth iced coffee on demand.  I used to have to slow brew coffee for over 12 hours to get rid of the bitterness, and it still wasn't this good.",5
904,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/26/2021,The coffee tastes great and the idea is great. But it’s a little expensive,4
905,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/26/2021,Jot is good. I used to grind my own beans to make cold brew and let it sits in the fridge for 16 hours. I would say Jot tastes as good but it makes it easier.,5
906,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/25/2021,I bought two jot bottles on a whim after they were advertised on my instagram feed. I have to say the coffee tastes great and it is so convenient and easy to make. I've enjoyed trying different ways of making my coffee in the morning. It's easy to make ice coffee on the go too. I would definitely recommend it!,5
907,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/25/2021,"I expected this to be a higher quality version of instant coffee, but was pleasantly surprised that it exceeded my expectations.

911,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/25/2021,"The coffee is strong and intense and makes for a flavorful cup of latte. However, I wish there were a slightly wider selection instead of just normal and dark. The coffee had an acidic flavor and scent that I'm not a huge fan of (which I recognize is just my personal preference). If there were a bottle that's more nutty or caramel-y, it would be perfect.",4

916,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/25/2021,"When I was first reading about Jot, I thought it was going to be another one of those useless trends that would disappoint, yet I still wanted to try. My first cup of iced Jot coffee proved me wrong! I even texted several of my coffee loving friends telling them to give Jot a try. I get excited waking up, knowing I get to drink my iced coffee in my gorgeous Jot Fellow mug!",5
917,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/25/2021,I love how easy Jot makes creating the yummiest iced lattes!,5

924,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/25/2021,I love how creative I can be with Jot. It is the perfect ingredient to my WFH daily routine. I can add it to cold or hot water for a normal brew or make a fun drink in the afternoon with milk and Hersey's syrup! It makes me so happy to experiment with different flavors and because it is always just ready to go in my fridge it is faster than a trip to the local coffee shop. So great to mix up a boring day.,5
925,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/25/2021,"The best coffee concentrate I’ve ever tried, and if tried most of the commercially available brands. So glad there is a dark option for those like me who enjoy a stronger brew. I can’t wait to try it hot and test out different recipes.",5
926,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/25/2021,"I made my first cup and took a sip, my reaction was as follows ""I can't lie - this is good."" I've tried a lot of pre-made coffee bottles and for the price and amount this is really great. I especially like how I'm in control of the strength because a lot of pre-made bottles are too watery. anyway blah. blah blah. It's really good and worth the price.",5
927,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/25/2021,"I was originally scared to try this coffee because every time I try a new coffee it’s just ok and I don’t care for the flavor, but I ended up loving it! I thought I would just like the original flavor, but I actually like both the original and the dark. I will for sure buy some more when I run out.",5
928,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/25/2021,A friend referred Jot to us and we took a chance. We are sure glad that we did! The coffee is super-smooth and delicious :),5
929,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/25/2021,"I love cold brew coffee, Jot definitely hits that mark.  It has great flavor, easy to make and has so many different versions you can create. I was a fan with my first cup.  So glad I didn’t took the chance and purchased.  You won’t be disappointed.",5
930,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/25/2021,"Depending on what side of the fence you’re on, in  terms of coffee, one could say I’m either a coffee snob, or coffee trash…. You see, I am a Starbucks drinker, I’m one of the many people who like a strong cup of coffee but don’t know enough to get the nuanced notes of the bean type. Home brews never quite fit the bill, and honestly neither do other coffee shops around Seattle, where I live. To my dad, and other people who think weak, diner coffee is good coffee, I’m a foolish coffee snob who spends too much money on coffee. To the actual lover of fine coffees, who knows a ton, I’m coffee trash, drinking over roasted **** water. But alas, I have always waved my flag honestly and owned my coffee demons (No hate Starbucks…. I love you). So as you can imagine, I was skeptical that this glass jar of coffee concentrate would be anything I’d actually like. But for a free tumbler, and knowing I have people in my house who will drink it regardless, I gave Jot a try. To my surprise, it’s super good coffee. It’s very smooth like cold brew, when mixed with cold milk, how I take it. It’s got a natural sweetness to it, without being sweetened, and it’s not overly bitter. For me though, it’s the mouthfeel that normal home coffees are missing. The viscosity of this coffee is awesome.  It comes in much cheaper than my beloved Starbucks as well, which will help my monthly budget.  All and all, I’m super happy and will likely order again this again. It takes less than a minute to make, and I’m on my way. Jot actually tastes and fulfills the coffee need for me, and that’s not something any other make at home products has been able to do.",5
931,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/25/2021,At first i was skeptical but when I received it I was amazed! the little travel mug that I received was really cute and I made a cup with oat milk and i swear i’m never going back to ground coffee again ♥️,5
932,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/25/2021,"Love the dark brew. Wife loves the regular, mix it with  some vaults and half a cup of coffee and it’s ready to go 😎",5
933,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/25/2021,"I love that it's the perfect brew every time. The day I got it I literally made 3 cups because it was THAT GOOD. I don't have to set up the espresso machine every morning or worry about cleaning it! I will say one thing though, my boyfriend tried it with almond milk and it turned sour.. not sure if anyone else had the same issue..",4
934,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/25/2021,This coffee is amazing….. I think I’m hooked.,5

936,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/25/2021,"Jot doesn't beat a fresh pour over or espresso drink, but given that I can pour one tablespoon into a cup of anything straight from my fridge and get a huge caffeine boost is great. 150mg per serving is also very strong but the taste isn't overpowering at all.",4
937,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/25/2021,"It’s very smooth and strong and clean tasting but at the end there’s a bloomy aftertaste that reminds me of day old tea 
Not gonna repurchase",3
938,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/25/2021,Super easy to use.  Makes a great iced coffee!,5
939,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/25/2021,"Quick and great taste that can not be beat! The coffee is very smooth and offers a similar taste as a far more expensive coffee shop. Would recommend to anybody, especially those that are pressed for time in the mornings!",5
940,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/25/2021,"I received my first shipment of Jot and have been loving it. The taste is really good.  I would say it definitely has a better coffee taste than what you get at the big coffee shops. It has made making a morning latte for my wife really easy, while I have a nice cold brew.",5
941,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/25/2021,"I have really loved the regular Jot a lot - its super easy to make a single cup of coffee when I really want just a bit more, or on days I am running out of the house quickly and don’t have time to make a pot. 

I am usually a fan of lighter or medium roasts so I haven’t enjoyed the dark as much, but I am happy to have more than one bottle around.",5
942,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/25/2021,Just as smooth as described! Even impressed my die-hard venti latte-drinking husband so much he has at least one Jot a day now!,5

10/10 RECOMMEND!",5
945,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/25/2021,I have greatly enjoyed my Jot coffee. The taste is very smooth and the convenience of making an iced latte at home vs waiting in a drive through has been a game changer. I had tried other coffee products at home but none of them allowed me to get the coffee house taste just right but Jot does this.,5
946,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/25/2021,Nothing to complain about. Good and fast coffee.,5

949,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/25/2021,The best coffee I ever tried that’s ready to go…With or without milk it’s strong and smooth taste. Love it…,5
950,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/25/2021,"Yes. The answer to your questions, ""is it any good?"", ""Is it worth it?"" And ""should I ask her out?"" Just do it man. ",5
951,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/25/2021,"Need I say more? Maybe. Perhaps I ought to say ""don't make this with straight whole milk and sugar"" but then I'd be assuming you don't like melted coffee ice cream. Or... Perhaps I should say ""don't mix this with a cup of hot chocolate"" but then I'd be assuming you hate happiness and joy. 

I dunno, man. I can't tell you how to live your life. It's coffee. You know what to do with it.",5
952,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/25/2021,"I drink a lot of cold brew, at some point I should really make it myself, but this is the next best environmentally conscious option. This concentrate is delicious.",5

954,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/25/2021,"This is really smooth. I take 2 tbs, 1C silk nut protein milk and 1C water to make my morning caffeine fix. Taste great, no bitterness and easy.

957,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/25/2021,"This is such a game changer for my mornings, especially when I’m on the go or running late. With the weather getting colder, I prefer hot coffee. And to put heat the kettle and add a spoonful of Jot with my favorite almond creamer is quick, easy, and the perfect way to start my day.",5
958,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/25/2021,This coffee is so good and not bitter at all. I do a tiny splash of milk now and that’s all I need. Great for saving on calories without sacrificing taste.,5
959,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/25/2021,"I love jot!  I primarily use it to add coffee to protein shakes or mixes, but it is great just added to hot or cold water to drink black.",5
960,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/25/2021,The original strength jot is wonderful. I have tried it hot and iced! I loved both of them. I will continue to order in the future.,5

966,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/24/2021,"I was looking for a way to have iced coffee everyday.

969,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/24/2021,I am a sucker for a great cold brew.  This beats what I normally pay $5.00 or more for at the local coffee shop!  The best part is it is available anytime I want it!,5
970,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/24/2021,Wow! Trying to cut out the creamer/sugar & this coffee is absolutely UH-MAZING! ✨,5
971,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/24/2021,"Honestly when I ordered this, I thought it was a gimmick - but I was pleasantly surprised! It’s convenient and very tasty.

979,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/24/2021,I am a sensible coffee drinker to say the least. I have to say I am very happy and satisfied with my first purchase of Jot.

980,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/24/2021,I saw an ad online and decided to try Jot based on all of the positive reviews. I’m glad that I did. The taste is great and the price is a lot better than what I’d been spending on coffee elsewhere! The free mug really sealed the deal for me. Thank you!,5
981,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/24/2021,"Jot is the best tasting, easiest to make, most effective cup of coffee I have ever had. It takes 2 minutes every morning to make a refreshing and powerful energizer for the rest of the day. I received one of the travel mugs, and I used it all the time. Everything is very well thought through, and designed to perfection. — I would LOVE to see a decaf option! I love the taste of Jot, and would be thrilled if there was a decaf option as well. 

Thank you Jot, for starting out my day in the best way.",5

Its super easy to make, tastes incredible, and doesn't produce daily waste like regular coffee grounds, pods, or even tea bags like my old routine use to create. I think I like the dark more, but my hubby likes the original so the 2 bottles serve us well! Going to be a Jot customer for a long time!",5
988,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/24/2021,"The idea of Jot seems too easy! I hate using a Keurig or any other method to make caffeine in a mug. Jot makes it easy to make a flavorful iced brew in 30 seconds. I pour it over ice, coconut milk and pumpkin spice stevia for my quick caffeine fix in the morning. Thanks Jot!",5
989,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/24/2021,Recently been into making coffee concentrates since I have no time in the morning to make coffee otherwise and didn’t want to spend money on buying everyday.

994,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/24/2021,"I said surprisingly because I thought it is going to be normal average coffee (especially it’s packed for a while in the bottle) but when I open the bottle, the coffee smell like fresh brew!!! The taste and the strength the same level like espresso. It’s saves my daily morning routine, either making a cup of ice latte or hot latte. Delicious!!!",5
995,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/24/2021,"I am always looking for a way to have a great cup of coffee while backpacking and camping, with minimal effort and mess. French press coffee, while tasting great, can be messy and produces food waste that must be disposed of. I thought I was relegated to small packs of instant coffee until I found Jot. I can add boiling or cool water to the ultra coffee and have the same quality of coffee that I would have at home. And Jot makes it easy to customize the strength of your cup, so everyone in your party gets a cup of coffee they enjoy.",4
996,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/24/2021,I was pleasantly surprised that Jot Ultra Coffee is so smooth and flavorful. You really just need 1 tablespoon for a quick coffee at home. I plan to leave some at work for when I need a quick pick me up.,5

1009,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/23/2021,"Jot tasted better than instant, and even better than some fresh coffee brands. Its mostly smooth and rich, not bad for hot coffee. It might taste better iced. I love how easy it is to prepare. What it could do better is reduce the acidity and get that usda organic certification.",4

I’d also notice the quality would get worst on day three do you oxygenation. Jot tastes better, super convenient, less waste, and takes no prep. Need coffee in order to work out in the morning. Now I have one less excuse. Hopefully Jot can work towards free trade beans",5

1015,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/23/2021,If i can only travel with these bottles on longer flights i would. I’m not a coffee connoisseur but I’m pretty much 80% coffee. Tablespoon does the trick a whole day and I wouldnt even need a second cup. Yet it is sooo good to the taste with or without creamer.  Definitely would be a consistent buyer.,5

But with JOT, not only have I had iced coffee twice a day for the past week, I was okay with SHARING my iced coffee with my fiancé. I know right!? Anyways, I’m hooked on the flavor, just perfect and it’s only one tablespoon! I order the two original and dark flavored coffee and I knew that if I didn’t act on their special price a couple days ago, I’d regret it, so I order more JOT.

1031,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/23/2021,I love this stuff. Better than the coffee machine at work and it is a fresh brew type machine too.,5
1032,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/23/2021,Saw so many ads for this and glad I finally tried it. Definitely love the dark roast the best. Quick to make and it tastes great so definitely makes those really early morning shifts a lot easier,5

1035,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/22/2021,"Having tried and finished my first bottle, I can safely say that I’m obsessed! I love the original iced with oat milk, but the dark is best when I’m in the mood for a hot cup. Definitely will be continuing the subscription! Love how fast and easy it is in the mornings. I kind of wish decaf was available (or half-caf) so I can drink more without getting the jitters. 😉",5
1036,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/22/2021,This coffee is great.  Especially when you are strapped for time.  Just pour and go!,5
1037,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/22/2021,I am really enjoying my Jot! I save it for later in the day for a special cup! Really happy I gave this a try. It has replaced my early evening run to Starbucks!,5
1038,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/22/2021,"We have had single cup machines, traditional coffee pots, percolators, and cold brew devices.  We've used coffee that is $5 a bag to $15 a bag.  We've tried dozens of varieties, some brought back from faraway trips.  This cup of coffee was my favorite.  Its smooth, easy, and great hot or cold.  It's already a new staple at home and I can't wait to have easy coffee when we camp next summer.  I'm pretty dang happy over here.",5
1039,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/22/2021,I’m a die hard coldbrew fan and drink the concentrates straight so I was definitely surprised when 1-2 tablespoons was all I needed! Delicious and takes up so much less space in my fridge!,5
1040,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/22/2021,Jot for the win!,5
1041,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/22/2021,"Honestly I’m really enjoying the dark roast! 
Easy of use is great for me bc I’m always on the run. The taste is great. Fav has been my iced latte with jot. It’s a win!",5
1042,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/22/2021,Tried my first bottle and started sending out to friends and family. That good!,5
1043,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/22/2021,I always end up caving and stopping by to buy coffee because I am always running late. A cup of Jot is super quick and easy to prepare and it tastes amazing. I seriously prefer it to chain coffee shops now. The packaging is beautiful and the free ceramic travel mug was a amazing plus.,5
1044,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/22/2021,"I had seen this online, so I thought I'd give it a try and I love it! It tastes super good, and it's super simple to use! Iced coffee is now much easier to make and I can now take it to work with me since it takes next to no time at all to make.",5

1046,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/22/2021,Just started with my first order and am loving this coffee and the convenience of it. I have already placed a second order.,5
1047,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original (Trial),10/22/2021,"Jot is for the coffee drinkers (and the bakers) I would not recommend this hard-hitting elixir to those who wake up for coffee and essentially have ice cream in a cup. No shade to Frappuccino lovers but some pile in the sweet stuff and those who throwback a bullet of espresso like a shot of tequila. If you want cost-effective richness in your mug every morning, forget the pot, filters, and the k-cups. Just add a dash of Jot to your milk of choice and you’ll be off and running.",5
1048,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/22/2021,"I'm not much of a coffee drinker, but because of Jot, this might be a daily thing for me....uh oh.... I also got 3 of my co-workers into Jot, now that they had a taste. The coffee is delicious and easy to make, and they go SO well with vanilla oat milk. 5 stars!",5
1049,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/22/2021,"I really love the taste and then noticed on several occasions that after drinking Jot, I had a sense of well being.  I thought - What Is In This Jot??  I'd still like to know.  I drink coffee ea morning very lightly.  An inch of coffee in a mug would last me the day.  Jot - I love it cold and have a glass most mornings",5
1050,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/22/2021,It’s as easy as they say: just mix with hot water and it tastes like normal (but good) coffee. Dangerously easy. I  want to drink too much coffee.,5
1051,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/22/2021,"I love how quick and easy it is - for someone like me who is always running late, that’s a must. It’s also a truly delicious cup of coffee. I will definitely be buying more in the future.",5
1052,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/22/2021,Rich coffee flavor and easy to make a solid cup either hot or cold.,4

1054,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/21/2021,"Great taste, easy to make and great packaging. Love that we can keep it in fridge without it being a huge bottle and not all the sugar **** in it. Great packaging and bottles.",5

1057,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/21/2021,I was pretty skeptical but I really like Jot both hot and cold. I think it has a slightly better flavor when cold which is perfect for me since I was making my own cold brew prior to finding Jot.,5
1058,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/21/2021,"I was skeptical when I first saw Jot, but gave it a try anyway because the value proposition intrigued me. Immediately, I was impressed with the quality of packaging and presentation of the product. I made a hot latte as my first cup and Holy cow, I was hooked. I then made my wife a cup and she loved it as well. I love how quick and easy it is to make an amazing cup of coffee, something resembling expensive coffee house coffee but with even better flavor.",5
1059,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/21/2021,"For coffee made in an instant, this is great! I like it as an oat milk latte. I also tried it as a regular coffee and it was robust and smooth though there was a tang afterward. Good in a pinch and definitely better than any other instant coffee I’d had.",4
1060,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/21/2021,Absolutely delicious and goes great with any milk substitute or creamer. Glad I finally gave Jot a try after seeing it mentioned on Instagram for months.,5
1061,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/21/2021,"I purchased the original and dark flavors as a gift for my boyfriend’s birthday, and he was surprised by the flavor and ease of use on the go. The coffee is veryyy good, both hot and cold! Thank you!!",5
1062,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/21/2021,"We love making our own cold brew, but having this on hand is super convenient for the times we don’t have time to brew our own and taste great !",5
1063,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/21/2021,"Instead of spending $6-12 a day on iced coffees, this is definitely my new go-to! Quick, easy and delicious!",5
1064,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/21/2021,Great alternative to tradition brewing or instant coffee. Jot tastes much better and is a great solution for those of us who get up with little time before needing to get out of the house!,5
1065,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/21/2021,This is the best coffee I’ve tested!,5
1066,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/21/2021,"This coffee has grown on me. I love how easy and convenient it makes my mornings. Also, being concentrated, makes it great over ice cream. Still a little pricey, but have enjoyed these.",4
1067,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/21/2021,"So easy to prepare either hold, cold or with milk. It is a smooth tasting coffee with good flavor and you can really control the strength of your cup! Highly recommended.",5
1068,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/21/2021,"I love americanos and sometimes I’m just don’t have the time to setup the machine and pull the shots. This is an amazing alternative and is becoming a part of my daily routine. Both flavors have a lot of the characteristics and flavor profiles that come with espresso. Also, the mug that came with the set is fantastic.",5
1069,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/21/2021,"As someone who can “sometimes snooze their alarm”, Jot has really saved me time in the mornings! Plus the taste is good and I have not gotten that gross jittery feeling that I get from some major coffee chains. 10/10 - Worth the risk of trying it out!!",5
1070,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/21/2021,"I love the simplicity, but just don't think it tastes as good as fresh ground beans in the morning. Definitely better than ""instant"" but has a slightly burnt flavor? Jury is still out!",3
1071,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/21/2021,Great coffee! Not bitter at all and doesn’t taste processed. A+,5
1072,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/21/2021,"I was worried that it would taste “processed” but it really did taste like coffee! Great coffee at that. I was also really worried that I would use more than the 1 Tbsp, but nope! And the topo tumbler is great!",5
1073,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/21/2021,"Honestly having it iced is incredibly.  I prefer that to nearly any iced coffee I have tried.  It’s great hot as well, but iced, iced it’s money.",5
1074,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/21/2021,It’s not as good as specialty coffee but it’s about as good as the cold brew you’ll get at most places. The time it saves is the real plus. It’s super convenient and definitely good.,5
1075,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/21/2021,It saves me so much time during the day and gives me the boost I need!,5
1076,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/21/2021,"I’ve been called by a few friends a coffee snob and I initially was hesitant to try as I have an awesome espresso machine at home. However, since I’ll be traveling soon, I thought this would be a convenient way to make a strong coffee and boy I feel lucky I took a chance on this! The flavors are strong and bold but never bigger or acidic. I add water and a splash of oat milk with jot and it’s absolutely perfect for coffee on the go! Yum!",5

1079,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/20/2021,I am a coffee and tea drinker. I love both but I have always had trouble replicating my favorite coffee drinks from my local coffee shop. But now with Jot I have no trouble making delicious coffee drinks! Thank you Jot!,5
1080,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/20/2021,I've been drinking Jot mixed with hot water and have just about gone through the first bottle. Taste so good and so easy to make. I've been using Jot for a cup of afternoon joe. This is now my go to afternoon cup of coffee.,5
1081,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/20/2021,It tastes so good and smooth! I purchased it at work because it tastes so much better than keurig coffee!,5
1082,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/20/2021,"I bought Jot coffee because I like afternoon coffee, but I hate the hassel of brewing a pot, when I just want a little pick-me-up.  I'm so glad I gave it a try - it's delicious!  I like it so much, I went back an ordered another 2 bottles to give as gifts this Christmas.  I paired with it an espresso cocktail recipe book and a handheld milk frother.  I can't wait for my friends to open up their Christmas gifts!  I'm sure they will love Jot as much as I do.",5
1083,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/20/2021,"I’ve tried various at home cold brew options. Jot is easy, compact and tastes good. I’ll be ordering again.",5

1085,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/20/2021,"It so easy to made without leaving your house/office. Just add cold water, a tablespoon or 2 then your choice of milk. I use coconut + almond milk and it's taste awesome ! The flavor and aroma is up to par with those newly brew coffee at fancy coffee shop. And I do my own dripping coffee for fun but Jot just taste way better.",5
1086,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/20/2021,Flavor was excellent. I mixed it wit condensed milk to have that copy the Vietnamese coffee experience. I wish  Jot will do there own creamer,5
1087,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/20/2021,"I'm pretty particular about coffee but Jot has won me over. A little ice, some almond milk and I've got one of the best cold brews I've tried. Great stuff",5

1096,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/19/2021,I really enjoyed this coffee...I made the mistake of drinking it with creamer and now I can't look back. Still have to figure out the ratio but it is nice that you can do so much with it!,5
1097,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/19/2021,"I love this stuff. I ordered it because I've been trying to figure out how to recreate Starbucks' brown sugar oatmilk shaken latte (yeah I'm basic), and Jot is perfect. Also, their customer service is baller. My order never shipped, and when I let them know they reissued it right away with expedited shipping!",5
1098,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/19/2021,Jot has been the best addition to my mornings with a newborn! The work is done all I have to do is customize how I like it :) can’t wait to continue this in my back to work routine.,5
1099,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/19/2021,"I’m picky about my iced coffee- I mix with 6oz instead over ice, but the flavor is great. Plus, it saves so much room in my fridge as opposed to the big jugs!",5
1100,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/19/2021,"I'm a consistent cold brew/iced coffee drinker and while I like supporting my favorite local coffee shops, the hit to my wallet every week isn't fun.

1102,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/19/2021,"As someone who always brewed their own coffee, hand grinding whole beans and brewing iced pour over every morning, the Jot coffees are both very convenient to make and tastes great.

The time saved alone is worth it.",5

1105,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/19/2021,As a former Starbucks Manager i can say I'm changed. I am actually more of a tea snob with extensive coffee knowledge but would only drink coffee socially. Jot is some of the purest tasting coffee concentrate there is in the market. Its easy to make myself an iced latte without having to bring out the Nespresso machine. Its really easy. Too easy even. I've gotten the subscription for the dark and original. At first i was skeptical and believed that because i wasn't a real fan of coffee that these two bottles were going to be my last. I was wrong. I tried the original and the taste was absolutely delicious. Then i tried the dark and was equally blown away. I recommend both blends. The original has some chocolate notes with a bright finish. The dark has a more earthy taste but it doesn't come with a harsh bitterness. I will continuing this subscription for sure!,5
1106,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/19/2021,"Have enjoyed my first few cups of Jot coffee. I tried both a hot coffee/latte (using hot water and steamed milk) and iced (using ice and cold oat milk). Both were delicious and super easy to make. Thanks, Jot!",5

I am now drinking this exclusively. I'm energized throughout the day with no midday crash whatsoever, I feel sharper and more alert as well. If you are wondering if you should try this.. do it. You will not be disappointed.",5
1108,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/19/2021,"I chose 2 bottles, one of the regular and one of the dark, and am very glad I did.  My wife and I have spend the past week coming up with ways to use the concentrate -- from straight up iced coffee, to cold frothed milk lattes, to adding dashes of Jot to our cooking.  Aside from being a coffee guy, I'm also a nerd, and the financials of Jot make sense, so far as well.  Since a tablespoon is a good starting point for most drinks, the cost per drink is incredibly low for a quality retail product.",4

He tried it first when I was at work and immediately texted me how much he was blown away. I tried it the next morning and was pleasantly stored by how strong and smooth the flavor presented itself. Love it!,5
1116,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/18/2021,I'm so pleased with Jot! The quality and simplicity definitely makes it worth buying more in the future.,5

1118,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/18/2021,I tried Jot for the first time and I’m impressed. I love the flavor which is of utmost importance but I also appreciate that I’m not buying and lugging home plastic cold brew coffee containers that have to be recycled. I would definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys an iced coffee beverage. I’m looking forward to trying it hot as well. Cheers!,5
1119,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/18/2021,"I'm a big iced coffee fan but I'm also lazy. I tend to make a batch or two of cold press coffee at home and then fizzle out for a while, which makes trips to the coffee shop inevitable. $$$ 

Jot allows me to quickly prepare a delicious cup of iced coffee in the morning with minimal clean up or waste. And with the customizable subscription I can edit my shipments from month to month, which is super handy. Would recommend!",5

1123,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/18/2021,"After seeing Jot in an ad I was very curious but a little wary of if I would find it worth it. I decided to try it out after seeing other reviews saying it was good. I'm glad I did because I honestly find it so delicious! It's really strong and once watered down with the recommended 8 oz (and even more) it's still really decadent and delicious. The experience they give you for the price is also super nice, down to the branded box my order came in to the super cool glass bottles with a cork lid. I like them a lot!

If you love coffee I would say this tastes a lot like espresso, and you can make really delicious drinks with it without all the hassle or buying an espresso machine. I'm honestly surprised with every sip by how much it tastes like a latte when milk is added. I still have to figure out my favorite way to prepare drinks with Jot, but I'm excited to drink it every day!",5

I've used a Keurig Mini in the mornings for the last couple years but just like all my other ones, it has stopped working. Jot is easier, quicker, and tastes better. I also like iced coffee so mixing Jot with some cold vanilla almond milk is awesome! I will definitely order more bottles!",5

1134,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/18/2021,"After trying both the ultra coffee and the dark ultra, I think the dark is the way to go! Will be purchasing more. Way more convenient than brewing my own cold brew",5
1135,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/18/2021,"I will admit the price is a little steep, BUT it’s delicious and convenient and overall I’m sold and will continue to purchase.",5
1136,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/18/2021,"After months of making and then chilling my own coffee (which took FOREVER) I can now have barista tier coffee in a minute. Super easy, super tasty, super cheap compared to buying everyday!",5
1137,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/18/2021,I honestly didn't think I would be so obsessed with this coffee but I had been my staple since it arrived. I find myself excited each morning to mix my perfect iced jot coffee.,5
1138,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/18/2021,I absolutely love your product!!! I’m in a semi austere location. So good coffee is hard to come by. Your products have been absolutely amazing.,5
1139,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/18/2021,"Coffee when not at home has always been hard for me. Jot makes it easy. I know it is supposed to be refrigerated. I do my best to keep it in the fridge but so far, a few hours out of the fridge during travel has kept good coffee in my mug when on the go",5
1140,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/18/2021,"For me, this was a treat.  Paying more for Jot instead of just making my own cold brew was something I would try just this once and then go back to my regular.  Well, now I don't what to do.  It's good.  Real good.  And it's easy.  And by the way, it's good.  Do I deserve to spend the extra?  I think I'm a good person so....  Did I mention, it's real good?",5
1141,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/18/2021,"As the review title says: this cold brew concentrate i) tastes great, and ii) is extremely convenient.  What more can you ask? :-)",5
1142,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/18/2021,I was interested in a coffee concentrate and jot had a sweet bundle deal. The mug literally keeps my coffee cold or hot for 12 + hours. I am glad I ordered jot and cant wait till I finish my bottles so I can order more!,5
1143,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/18/2021,I love this stuff! To be honest the original flavor got boring but the Dark is just amazing! I love it and I’ve actually gotten a friend or two hooked on it. I usually do the iced coffee take on it but in the winter I’ll try warm milk.,5
1144,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/18/2021,Skeptical about trying concentrate coffee for the first time but this exceeded my expectations. Very happy with my purchase. Bought the two pack and got the travel mug with it as well. Gave one bottle to my friend that loves coffee and she was impressed with it as well. Will definitely be buying again once I’m out!,5
1145,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/18/2021,Delivery was quick.  The taste and quality of the coffee was amazing.  Both my wife and I love it.  I now need to buy a second container as she took mine:). Great value!,5
1146,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/17/2021,"I decided to try Jot because they were running a deal with a free tumbler included with a purchase of 2 bottles. I got free shipping and decided to order a tablespoon as well, because I’m a college student and obviously don’t have one lying around. It wasn’t in the box in my original order, but a quick email to customer service got this resolved kindly and immediately. I’ve tried the original so far and loved it, and I’m also excited to try the darkroast I got. Convenient and so easy. Very happy!!!!",5
1147,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/17/2021,"We opted for the two bottle subscription to get the free glassware. I will say my wife really loves the glasses, she uses them all the time. 
The coffee experience just falls a little flat for me. It reminds me of a coffee flavoring more than actual coffee. I really wanted to love this coffee as a way to jazz up my afternoon routine.  Each day I go to the refrigerator hoping this is the time I really enjoy it, but every time my optimism is gently let down. It is in no way bad, just not what I was hoping for. I have tried it as an iced coffee, and a hot cafe breve, each according to the included recipe card multiple times. Lovely glassware though, cute artwork.",3
1148,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/17/2021,"Jot Dark + water is the way to go (I'm not a fan of mixing it with milk/milk alternative). If you're a person on the go, or in a rush but need a cup, it takes about 10-15 seconds to put a cup together. Just 6 oz water + 1 TBSP + Ice, and I'm off!",5
1149,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/17/2021,I have tried this for the first time and it is now my go to.  I love the taste and the ease of this product. All I can say......it's a keeper.,5

1152,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/17/2021,"I never have time in the morning to make coffee in the morning, and making a pitcher of cold brew takes time and space in the fridge. With jot, it’s so convenient to mix up and throw some condensed milk in for sweetness. Yum!",5
1153,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/17/2021,"Wow! I only bought 1 bottle because I was apprehensive about the taste but it is sooooo delicious. It’s also so strong! After 1 cup, I feel ready for the day 😊",5
1154,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/17/2021,"Even in times I’m running late for work in the morning, this makes a cup of coffee done in seconds. Even when I’m not late this is so quick it gives me the inspiration to make a quick solid breakfast to go with before I head out. I love it and it’s the best tasting coffee concentrate I’ve ever had.",5
1155,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/17/2021,"I will buy more. Great cup of coffee. Delicious, quick, and extremely satifying.",5

1157,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/17/2021,"Jot is the fastest, easiest, and tastiest way I've found to have good coffee quick. Be it iced or just cool it tastes great, mixes well, and gives me the boost I need in the morning to get to the job site ready and willing to make that money!",5
1158,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/17/2021,"After seeing the carb and sugar count in the “sugar free” Latte at the well-known coffee house, I started looking for my own recipe. Your Espresso was the crowning glory of my new favorite Latte. Thank you!",5
1159,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/17/2021,normal is too light and sour; prefer ultra,3

I love the blend, the portability - just took one bottle on a trip! - and the ease of having arrive right to my front door. In LOVE with the travel mug, too - whose brilliant idea was that removeable guard? Makes my morning iced coffee perfect :)",5
1162,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/16/2021,Time to brew a full pot of coffee isn’t always on my schedule… an afternoon quiet time cuppa of Jot is a welcome addition to my day!  Thank you!!,5
1163,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/16/2021,Makes a fantastic cup of joe! Wish you sold a larger bottle.,5
1164,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/16/2021,I don't think Jot will replace my Aeropress coffee ritual but I love the convenance of it.  I drink a lot of coffee at work and it's nice to be able to keep a bottle in the fridge and just worry about bringing in hot water in a thermos.,5
1165,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/16/2021,"I've always been more of a tea person, but this is so easy and convenient when I really need to make my brain go fast. Both the dark and the original are delicious, but the dark is my favorite. It has quickly become a staple in my office",5
1166,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/16/2021,"Not only is Jot delicious, full-flavored coffee, but easy too! Thanks Jot!",5
1167,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/16/2021,I didn't love it. I didn't hate it. I'll probably keep looking for a good cold brew option at home. This one was just not a flavor I loved.,3
1168,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/16/2021,I was really surprised by the flavor. My daughter hijacked it for her vanilla latte and loves it also!,5
1169,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/16/2021,My son surprised me with a gift package of Jot.  After my first cup I couldn't wait to call and thank him.  I couldn't believe how smooth it was.  I finished both bottles in no time and now have a monthly subscription.  I'm hooked!  I just love it!,5
1170,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/16/2021,"No reason to go to Starbucks for a latte or Mocha anymore (they can’t get my flavor in stock right now anyways). This is the perfect replacement and cost so much less! I can have several a day (with extra “shots” when needed) without any extra impact to my wallet, plus I don’t have to hear it from my husband! Haha! And obviously, it’s soooo delicious! There’s no going back!",5
1171,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/16/2021,Absolutely love Jot. I was looking for a quick ice coffee that taste great and Jot is the answer.,5

1173,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/16/2021,"I am an exhausted new mom to a 10-week-old, and Jot has been a saving grace! I can make hot or iced coffee in under a minute, and it's just as good as the coffee that takes ages to brew in our pot. And saving those few minutes every day gives us precious time back!",5
1174,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/16/2021,Fantastic product that lasted me a week and a half! So simple to make iced coffee or any other drinks in the morning. Takes the process out of making coffee without sacrificing an ounce of taste. Superb! Cannot wait to purchase more.,5
1175,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/16/2021,Simple and easy to use. Great customer service.,5
1176,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/16/2021,This coffee is amazing and way better than spending money for a cold brew at a shop multiple times a week. I just mix mine with oat milk and some maple honey or vanilla and its delicious. I will definitely be subscribing for more!,5
1177,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/16/2021,"Paired with our favorite milk, ice, and mocha syrup, we created a mocha that would make any barista blush when told we made it in 30 seconds!",5
1178,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/16/2021,Easy & very tasty!,5
1179,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/16/2021,Tastes great. just go get some..... Simple as that,5
1180,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/16/2021,Drink this everyday now! It’s so easy and fast and tastes great!,5
1181,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/16/2021,"Great quality coffee- I usually get heart palpitation from poor quality coffee but with coffee from Jot, I have never experience any discomfort! 
Love that the company is going for an environmentally friendly route and shipping and delivering coffee in everything that is recyclable:)",5
1182,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/16/2021,"I am not a coffee drinker, but I was intrigued by the ease of making coffee this way. This is making me into a coffee drinker! My husband likes the dark and I like the original. It’s so good and so easy!",5
1183,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/16/2021,"I was skeptical about JOT before until I tried it and my wife made it a particular way, 1 scoop of the coffee, 3 scoops of caramel creamer, some ice and some milk. OMG... never ever disappoints!! We now subscribe and get refills quite often, sometimes earlier than needed because we ALL love it lol Everyone that we have try it agrees about how we make it and cant get enough! JOT is great and recommend anyone to try it at least once! You won't be disappointed (like at certain coffee shops with a buck on them)",5
1184,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/16/2021,Love this,5
1185,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/16/2021,"I used to have to grind my own beans every morning and brew coffee but Jot coffee has been LIFE CHANGING. Not only that it is extremely convenient, it is also delicious and gets me out of bed and excited for the day!!!",5
1186,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/16/2021,"So far so good with my Jot coffee. I love the convenience of it for rushed mornings. I was curious if it would be strong enough for me and it seems to be good so far. Bonus is that I prefer iced coffee, so Jot makes that easy!",5
1187,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/16/2021,"I like that I can control every cup to my exact strength, but I didn't find it quite as strong as I was hoping for. I find that I need to put more than I expected to in order to get a similar dose of caffeine as I was expecting. Still tasty!",4
1188,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/15/2021,I bought this for my partner whom I didnt tell him when I gave him the cup of latte.  But he tried and was like ***. How did you do this? Starbucks?? Needless to say he was impressed and so happy he no longer needs to spen $6.50 at starbucks every day! Thank you,5
1189,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/15/2021,"I have 3 young kids, and I am a single mom. I am also a bit of a coffee snob and have always used whole bean coffee and a grinder immediately before brewing. What a time saver AND it’s delicious! I am so glad I gave you a try!",5
1190,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/15/2021,So eazy to make & such a wonderful way to start the day.,5
1191,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/15/2021,"I’ve always liked coffee but did not like the inconvenience of making it at home—not to mention I’m not the best it. So I always gravitated towards energy drinks. I wanted to kick my energy drink habit and switch to coffee. I tried making my own coffee, buying other brands, etc. but it never stuck. I received my first order of Jot last week and I haven’t turned back. It has officially converted me to a coffee drinker. It’s so simple and smooth. If you’re debating whether or not to order it—just do it!",5
1192,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/15/2021,This coffee is so flavorful and easy to make. I love that all you have to do is add water! I also follow their IG page to learn other ways to enjoy my Jot - makes for an elevated coffee drinking experience!,5
1193,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/15/2021,"Not only is Jot quicker and easier to make in the mornings than my normal cup of coffee, but it tastes way better than anything I can make at home.",5
1194,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/15/2021,Such an easy way to make a cup of iced coffee! I can't wait to play around with it more and try to make other drinks. I haven't even gone through the first bottle yet because a little goes such a long way!!!,5
1195,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/15/2021,This coffee is fantastical!! I purchased both the original and dark bottles and in just a week I ordered 2 more bottles!!! So glad I made the decision to try and will be a customer for a long long time!!,5
1196,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/15/2021,"Wow! Yes. “Wow.” 

Easily the best coffee concentrate that I’ve tried. I like a good strong cup and this delivered. 
Huge plus that it’s a glass bottle that fits easily in your fridge. 
Highly recommended.",5
1197,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/15/2021,This product has saved me so much time and $ and is incredibly tasty. Definitely continuing to purchase!,5
1198,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/15/2021,"When I signed up for Jot, to be honest I was expecting it to be ok, but probably not as good as I could get from a barista… I was WRONG! This has quickly become my favorite part of my day as I carefully craft each day’s designer drink. There is so much versatility with each cup, and the flavors are smooth and delicious on its own. One does it for me, two if I need an extra boost. I haven’t used even half a bottle yet and it’s keeping me well-caffeinated. Many thanks to the coffee gods who created Jot, my new favorite brew!",5
1199,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/15/2021,"I have been making a cup every morning (1 tablespoon of Jot with some cold oat milk) and it definitely picks me up! However, I also never have jitters at all throughout the day so it is the perfect amount of ""pick me up”. Also both flavors are very good and do have a distinct different taste from each other! Overall, very pleased and will definitely be a continued customer :)",5
1200,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/15/2021,Received the order faster than expected with great packaging! Immediately made the smoothest cup of coffee I have had in a very long time! Absolutely love the thermos! Perfect for traveling and amount of coffee I usually drink. Keeps liquids hot for a very long time! Can't wait to try the other coffees!,5
1201,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/15/2021,"I've gone through half a bottle so far and am sold enough to buy another two bottles as the convenience is too much to look past. As someone who enjoys the ritual of their morning pour over, having a fast and almost equivalent option for a delicious iced coffee during a rush makes it worth it. I have yet to break into my dark roast but I imagine it will align more with my tastes as I do feel the original is a touch acidic for me (but is actually well-balanced for any normal coffee drinker!).",4
1202,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/15/2021,I am an avid coffee drinker. I love the taste of coffee morning noon or night. I also work weird hours so the thought of a quick delicious coffee was very intriguing. I tried my first cup as an iced version. I followed the measurements and directions in the booklet and it looked pretty good. Then I tasted it….. it didn’t taste like coffee. I could tell it was trying but it was not good. It also has one of the weirdest aftertastes ever. I’m very disappointed by this because now I have two bottles. I’ve tried again a few times and tweaked the recipient to see if I could get it tasting better but had no luck. Maybe someone would doesn’t drink coffee would like it if this is all they knew. Anyone else want this jot?,3
1203,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/15/2021,Best tasting coffee I’ve ever had. I prefer espresso and this satisfies that without having a machine at home.,5
1204,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/15/2021,"I finally made the jump to order Jot since they offered the travel mug for free!  I read the reviews and thought I’d try it out myself. I like iced coffee, so that’s the first drink I made and I was pleasantly surprised! It tasted just as good as getting the same from Starbucks! I’m excited to make other coffee drinks with Jot. Thanks for making a great tasting, convenient product!",5
1205,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/15/2021,"I love how this isn’t acidic like some prepared coffee concentrates can be. I’m also prone to ‘caffeine anxiety’ & was mildly concerned the caffeine level would be a bit overwhelming, but it didn’t trigger any uneasiness. The flavor is great! It pairs really well with other add-ins. The travel mug is hands down best one I’ve owned. I’ll be keeping these on hand!",5
1206,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/15/2021,very smooth. love the taste!,5
1207,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/15/2021,very smooth and my family loves it.,5
1208,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/14/2021,"My five-star rating is for Dark ONLY because after tasting both Original and Dark (which shipped with my initial order), I found Dark rich, flavorful, and it packs the jolt I was anticipating. While Original packs the same jolt, I do NOT like the taste at all. It tastes like dirt to me.",5
1209,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/14/2021,My favorite way to drink coffee- I’ve made myself an iced latte every day since I got jot and i’m halfway through my second bottle!,5
1210,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/14/2021,"I have only tried one cup of each coffee one time. But I was not fond of the taste. I drink my coffee black, so I’m extremely picky. I will try different ways of making it. Not convinced, but not giving up totally.",3
1211,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/14/2021,Amazed at how Jot tastes with a little milk and sugar. Definitely will be my go to source of coffee when I return to work. It's so easy to make a cup of great tasting coffee.,5
1212,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/14/2021,I wouldn’t be surprised if all of the reviews had this title. Great taste easy to mix and it doesn’t take up as much room as that big pitcher does in my fridge. Even my wife says that Jot is a great cold brew!,5
1213,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/14/2021,I love the taste. Hard to describe but I’m starting to get addicted. Both original and dark tastes great. I’m more leaning towards dark and will definitely purchase again,5
1214,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/14/2021,Love this coffee so much!,5
1215,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/14/2021,Bro. This coffee slaps. Best over ice with water and splash of coconut milk *italian chef kiss*,5
1216,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/14/2021,"I can’t give it a 5 because there are a lot of other coffee concentrates out there doing the same thing…the same thing I do at home using a 3:1 water:grind for a 36 hour soak when I have time. It’s a decent tasting cold brew, but even the dark is kind of weak when made to their specs. I’ve found that doubling the Jot and not adding ice keeps it tasting like coffee, but I also only drink it black.",4
1217,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/14/2021,Tried this as I read lots of comments that it was a good coffee with no bitter after taste.  I love it.  Its easy to add to hot or cold beverages and tastes great.  And it is really easy to adjust the strength.,5
1218,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/14/2021,This is great coffee. Much better than instant and even tastes better than nespresso.,5
1219,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/14/2021,"I was looking for a convenient way to get coffee on the go, and Jot definitely fits the bill! The coffee tastes great, it’s eco-friendly, and an amazing time saver. Really innovative product, and I’ve been recommending to everyone!",5
1220,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/14/2021,"A few months ago, I decided to take up flying lessons off our steps in our home. I landed directly on my knee and shattered it. I ended up having to have surgery a couple weeks later, and I'm still crutch-bound. You know what sucks about crutches? Aside from putting all of your weight on one leg and getting exhausted very quickly, you can't carry anything! So I started carrying around a messenger bag. I still can't throw a plate of meatloaf in there (well, I could, but...), but I can throw my beloved leak-proof water bottle in there. I didn't drink any coffee from when I broke my leg in July until about a month ago (it's October now), because I've heard coffee - particularly caffeine - can slow down bone repair. But asking my wife for a cup or two of coffee every day just wasn't good. I could get up and, while I couldn't muster the strength to grind some coffee and wait for water to boil before making something in the Aeropress, I could use our Nespresso. But I couldn't take it anywhere.

I had heard of Jot in the past and decided to take them up - less about the concentrated coffee, and more about the included Fellow mug. And this thing has been a godsend. I can make a cup of coffee in the Nespresso and toss it right in my bag, stumble out to my office, and get to work with a fresh cup of joe in hand. And what's even better is I don't even have to take a trip to the Nespresso and wait - I can just grab the milk and the Jot out of the fridge and make a really good latte in just a couple minutes. I've only tried the original brew, but it's outstanding. It almost has a creamy quality to it, and the flavor is really good. It certainly isn't as good as going up to your local coffee shop and having an iced latte made for you by a professional barista on a $6,000 machine, but it's absolutely on par with Nespresso.

The only real downside, in my opinion, is the caffeine level. I wish a tablespoon was more like 100mg of caffeine instead of 150mg. You can use less, sure, and it'll stretch your bottle out longer, but then you get less coffee flavor. So if you're caffeine-sensitive, just be careful.

But, overall, I've really enjoyed Jot. Even if it isn't the best coffee on the face of the planet, it's dang tasty. Between it and the Fellow mug, it's one more thing I can be independent in doing, and that's worth more than just coffee.",4
1221,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/14/2021,"Official Jot convert. Love the concentrate, it’s rich without being bitter, it’s fantastic in iced coffee/lattes, and super fast to make. Gives me great caffeine buzz without the jitters.",5
1222,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/14/2021,"Jot is such a great easy coffee that turns into fantastic coffee drinks that are high quality and taste amazing. Mixes with milk, water, and any flavors very well.",4
1223,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/14/2021,Love drinking Jot! The bottles are very convenient and the lattes we make with jot are strong and delicious.,5
1224,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/14/2021,I bought a bottle of the dark in a bottle of the original and the original was so bad and so sour that I wasn’t going to bother trying the dark until a friend convinced me. The dark is delightful I drink my coffee black and iced and it taste like a local coffee shop. Absolutely loved it. I’ve even used it in a few cocktails. The original is sour and taste like the worst gas station coffee I’ve ever had which is kind of hilarious but also very disappointing,3

One thing i would appreciate, recipes. Also, whats the magic temperature for the hot water to make it more of an americano? New ways to use the product would be rad otherwise keep up the good work.",5

I usually put some sort of Stevia and either heavy cream or coconut cream in my coffee, but when I fast, I can’t do that. I’ve tried all sorts of black coffee, desperate to find something for fasting days. I finally decided to try Jot. I was so happy that the smooth, mellow, “clean”  taste is something that works black for me! Of course… It is wonderful with all of the extras in there as well LOL!",5

I don't have to make a full pot and waste it.  Second.  I bought a few bottles back in January thinking I was going to take them with me to work.  However, Our office closed for several months.  I Stored them in my pantry in the box they were shipped. Since my mom is here, she makes coffee quite often. For a while I didn't use any of the jot coffee. It is now October and I opened The bottle I bought back in January.  I forgot I had one left.  It was delicious.  No issues whatsoever.  I went ahead and bought some more.

1263,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/12/2021,"Each bottle of Jot is a financial investment of sorts, but it's called Just One Tablespoon for a reason: a little goes a long way in so many aspects. I can't attest to the taste of unadulterated Jot because I don't even like the flavor of coffee, let alone espresso-level products. The way I fix it that is absolutely delicious is Jot, 8oz of milk {I've used 1% and 2%}, 2Tbs of Splenda; stir really well; add faux ice cubes to really cool it down...and it's liquid happiness. Then I have a cup of black tea in the afternoon and I'm set for the entire day with my personal caffeine and flavor needs ☺",5

As a substitute high school teacher I need to be ready on a moments notice and Jot makes it sure that I have my fresh coffee in my cool thermal cup. Not only is it sleek and compact, it keeps my coffee hot for hours. But one of the best things about this cup is the splash guard! No hot messy gush coming from the cup at my mouth, just coffee in a controlled stream. Thank you for the coffee, thank you for the cup!",5

No machines, no grounds, just easy hot or iced coffee.the taste is great. No real complaints about the actual coffee. The cost is quite high and I'm not sure it's worth it. I only drink about a cup a day, so one bottle would almost make it half a month, or $50 a month for coffee if I bought 2 bottles upfront. If you buy one bottle + shipping, it's about $2.14 a cup of coffee. I'm definitely happy I tried it, I'm not sure I could afford to keep the habit going.",4

Although a little more pricey up front, it's worth the time you'll save brewing at home or the money you'll spend at a coffee shop to get a similar taste. Not only is it easy to make and full of flavor, but it's also well-packaged and the easy-pour spout makes for a neat cup of coffee (hot or cold). I can't wait to have my coffee friends try it too!

The concentrate makes for a great  cold drink I don't have to worry about the hot coffee diluting in melted ice and needing to add more ice so that my drink is cold. It's just good coffee and it's easy. I can think of other ways of using this as well, for baking and making an espresso martini. Told my friends about it and they are going to be trying it too!",5

1329,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/11/2021,I am pretty picky about my coffee and it’s been hard to find a convenient way to have good coffee without spending $6 a coffee but I’m almost through my first bottle and I’m loving it!

Highly recommended!",5

1341,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/10/2021,"I cannot recommend Jot highly enough. I usually make my own iced lattes at home. When I am running late for work and don't have time to brew espresso, Jot is easy to mix with milk and start my day. It tastes wonderful and is so simple.",5
1342,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/10/2021,"Aside from missing the measuring spoon that was supposed to come with my order, but did not, everything is great !",4
1343,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/10/2021,Jot is so good!!  I’ve tried other coffee concentrate but was never impressed. On a whim I decided to try Jot. I am so happy I did!!  It is so good and I will continue to order it!  Thank you Jot!!!,5
1344,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/10/2021,Definitely a game changer for making my protein coffee. I will continue to purchase. The dark roast is delicious!,5
1345,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/10/2021,Quality iced coffee!  Easy to make a lively drink at home. Will be reordering!!,5
1346,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/10/2021,So happy with the taste of this coffee and how easier it makes life in the mornings! Can’t wait to try the more bold version next!,5
1347,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/10/2021,"I'm not normally a dark roast coffee drinker, but was pleasantly surprised when I had my first taste!  I've thoroughly enjoyed both the regular and dark roasts Jot thus far.  I keep it as an emergency coffee for mornings I'm not able to make my standard pour over method.  My partner has also thoroughly enjoyed Jot as well.  I was able to get a Fellow cup with my first purchase and it has become my favorite travel mug too!  Love that I had the opportunity to try two things I've been interested in at the same time.  If you're on the fence, I'd give it a go as it has been a nice alternative!",5
1348,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/10/2021,This coffee is easy and delicious. I mixed my first cup with unsweetened vanilla almond milk over ice with a sprinkle of cinnamon on top!,5
1349,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/10/2021,I wasn't to sure about Jot but I wanted to give it a shot. It really is amazing. I add it to a iced coffee I buy from the store that is mostly milk and it makes it taste so much better.,5
1350,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/10/2021,"Truth is I use to be a tea drinker, the only reason I drink coffee is because of the caffeine. I tried jot because I needed a good tasting coffee that I didn’t have to wait in line for, and boy did Jot deliver (yes pun intended). One teaspoon works great , sometimes I use two but my main factor for buying this product again is that it tastes great and keeps me up during the day! Thanks a Jot !",5
1351,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/10/2021,Best coffee I've ever had!,5
1352,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/10/2021,The taste is delicious and I love the recipes that came with the delivery. I felt full of energy all day. I enjoyed how quick and easy it was to use Jolt. I’ve been drinking it almost everyday to start my morning.,5
1353,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/10/2021,"I’ve been trying out various brands of micro dose coffee over the past month or so. Jot is my favorite so far. I like strong coffee. All the other brands I’ve tried, I’ve had to use at least triple the suggested amount which makes it run out faster. I think my search may be over and I’ll stick with Jot!",5
1354,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/10/2021,I bought it on a whim and it turned out to be one of my new favorite things.,5
1355,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/10/2021,"After seeing ads for a while, I finally but the proverbial bullet and gave Jot a try. I was hooked after my first drink. It’s smooth with no acidic or bitter taste and is perfect for when I’m in a hurry. I’m hooked.",5
1356,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/10/2021,"I am a huge cold brew aficionado, the type of person who loves a black cold brew from any of the new indie coffee shops popping up all over.  Jot is amazing for me because I can bring that taste home and it’s easy to do, no brewing just stir a spoonful into ice and add a little water and off you go.  The flavor is tremendous and buying a bottle of Jot is much more cost effective than buying tons of those tiny cans.  Great job!",5
1357,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/10/2021,"This has to be the best coffee I've had in a long time, and it's a bonus that I don't have to wait for it to brew! I usually only have one cup of coffee each day, and I like that I can control how strong it is. I've had it both hot and cold, and with almond milk or water. It's excellent either way, no need to try to mask bitterness or change the flavor in any way.",5
1358,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/10/2021,"These Jot bottles are what I’ve been needing.
 I’m a fan of iced coffee/ cold brew, I’ve had the cold brew maker but that takes 12hrs. Jot is instant! I was a daily Starbucks drinker spending roughly $4 per iced americano. I will save over $75 per month now and can skip the long lines and time wasted waiting. 5 stars hands down!",5
1359,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/10/2021,I’ve been pretty happy with Jot so far. Seems to be quite a versatile product. I’ve mostly added it to my protein shakes in the morning making a protein infused mocha cold brew. We opted to subscribe for ongoing deliveries as a result.,5
1360,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/10/2021,Super convenient and tastes great. Live in Florida so drink iced coffee more than hot.,5
1361,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/10/2021,"I was skeptical before buying it, but I've deeply been enjoying making dirty matcha latte's right before running to class. Well done!",5
1362,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/10/2021,"Good taste, super convenient. Wish the bottles were bigger!",4
1363,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/09/2021,So easy and surprisingly good!,5
1364,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/09/2021,Jot tasted great and is so easy that now my girlfriend makes her own coffee in the morning if I’m not up yet (sad for me because I love making her coffee but speaks to the ease of use). We drink out of 16oz tumblers so we have to use a bit more than one table spoon but so far so good.,4
1365,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/09/2021,"My husband and I love Jot. He's a major fan of a specific drink at Starbucks and I can never get him to switch to an at home coffee. He loved this and even prefers it now to going out. Way to go, Jot!!",5
1366,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark (Extra Bottle),10/09/2021,My favorite!!!,5
1367,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/09/2021,Honestly… this was the best decision I’ve made this year!!! This purchase order has made my life a lot easier & pleasant… it’s so delicious & genius!!! I love this product!!! I love the BOLD FLAVOR!!!,5
1368,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/09/2021,"Delicious and easy, but a bit pricey- still cheaper than going to a coffee shop though.",5
1369,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/09/2021,"I decided to try Jot for the ease of making coffee, particularly iced coffee. Being able to simply mix 1 tbs with a few oz of water then add ice is appealing. After following the suggested ratio of water/Jot, I found the resulting drink to have a slight sour taste. It's a bit like how brewed coffee tastes when it's under extracted or the water isn't hot enough. Making iced coffee with Jot is better than using it for hot coffee. I tried it with hot water and the sour taste was very off-putting.",3
1370,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/09/2021,I work early mornings and I try to not wake up the others in the house. This has been the easiest way to make coffee EVER.,5
1371,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/09/2021,We love this coffee. My husband said we need to order some more. Neither of us normally like iced coffee but this is so smooth. We love it,5
1372,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/09/2021,"Great taste and easy measurements! . Love it in the morning in a protein shake for a quick breakfast on the go. Taste tested against another couple brands, but they were no competition; Jot won hands down every time!",5
1373,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/09/2021,Taste great hot or cold and easy to use. I am a coffee snob and I like this product.,5
1374,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/09/2021,"I am surprised by how good jot is. I’m a coffee snob, and this allows me to get a fast CB or one on the road very easy. Thanks",5
1375,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/09/2021,This is amazing and it shipped fast.,5
1376,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/09/2021,"Smooth and balanced, both original and dark versions went beyond expectations. Versatile and tons less effort than brewing, it has a place in my coffee routine",5
1377,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/09/2021,"In a time of short staffed and food shortages, this stuff helps me run a department of Nutrition for my school district. It helps all 5k students be fed on a daily basis.",4
1378,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/09/2021,This coffee is a great on-the-go coffee option,5
1379,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/09/2021,"Normally coffee for me is to get me through the day. I don’t think much about it; however, I was pleasantly surprised when I tried my first cup of Jot from a friend that had ordered it herself. The flavor was so smooth and fresh. Not bitter at all. And my energy throughout  the day was consistent. No crash from the caffeine. After that I knew I had to get my own bottle. The rest is history.",5
1380,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/09/2021,"I was a bit apprehensive to purchase Jot, but I am glad I did! This coffee is beyond smooth and so easy to prepare.  Unbelievably good!",5
1381,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/09/2021,I’ve tried making an ice coffee in the past and it just turns out watery but this is so easy to make and tastes delicious!,5
1382,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/09/2021,"I was worried that Jot would be a letdown, if I’m being honest. I’ve tried other quick solutions for coffee and always been disappointed. But that’s not the case with Jot. I add a little honey to some hot milk and my Jot and it’s just like a honey latte, only without the $5 price tag. What a gem!",5
1383,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/09/2021,"When I make coffee at home I normally grind it by hand for a pour-over or French press. If I want something iced, I’ll steep some cold brew for hours. Jot has been so convenient for my early schedule and let’s me grab coffee instead of an energy drink before work. It’s easy, fast, and tastes great both iced and hot.",5
1384,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/09/2021,Truly enjoyed each cup of iced coffee,4
1385,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/09/2021,"First of all I love that it’s so easy to make coffee to go, which is what I always to do as part of my morning routine. Now, the best part is, the taste is not compromised for the convenience! I love it.",5
1386,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/09/2021,"Husband and I LOVE our coffee. We love our regular drip and our trusty espresso machine but we’ve been on a search for ways to have cold-iced coffee/caffeine without it tasting watered down. Our prayers have been answered, you can throw this into cold drink to give it that kick and amazing coffee taste. Can’t wait to try it hot.",5
1387,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/09/2021,"I am always looking for a good cup of coffee ... and a way to save time and money.  Jot's ultra coffee hit the spot.  It was easy to make, took no time at all, costs less than my local coffee shop, and tasted great.",5

1389,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/09/2021,"I’m always willing to give something new a try and when I saw that jot was not only organic but was also a concentrated formula, I was incredibly curious and excited to give it a shot(pun intended). Come to find out, it’s everything they described it to be and more. 10/10",5

1392,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/09/2021,It tastes wonderful but I haven’t quite figured out the right ratio to make the best iced latte with flavors that I’ve used in past creations so taking me a bit of trial runs to get there.,4
1393,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/09/2021,It tastes wonderful but I haven’t quite figured out the right ratio to make the best iced latte with flavors that I’ve used in past creations so taking me a bit of trial runs to get there.,4
1394,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/09/2021,This is great for iced coffee! The only reason I gave 4 stars is because I don’t think it’s as good hot up and I need about 3.5 tbs for a small cup. But it’s definitely less bitter and seems less acidic. I’ll have to try the dark. Overall it’s a good buy and worth trying!,4
1395,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/09/2021,"I have to admit I was skeptical about what this would taste like.  I have to say it is AMAZING!  I love how easy it is to have great tasting, easily customizable coffee every morning without the crazy lines and prices at the chain coffee shops.",5
1396,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/09/2021,"I love to have an iced coffee in the afternoon and this is perfect for that! I like it a little stronger than the suggested serving of 1 tablespoon, but it’s great that it’s so easy to customize. I also really like the glass bottles the coffee comes in.",5
1397,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/09/2021,"Seriously amazing coffee, even better than the cold brew at my local fancy coffee shop. A little pricey for daily use but for special occasions or travel so worth it",5

I decided to give this coffee a try.. Let me tell you, it has been a game changer. Quick, easy and so delicious. Not to mention I'm saving money. I even got my partner who does not drink coffee at all, drinking it. I will be purchasing again. Thank you",5

1413,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/07/2021,"Jot has been a lifesaver, providing coffee at a pinch. I'm more of a 2 tablespoon person than the recommended 1 tablespoon but it has been perfect.

The cup that came with my purchase is the best compliment to the coffee. I'm a believer.",5
1414,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/07/2021,I’m an avid coffee drinker and very picky but have noticed it’s very difficult to get the right brew with my coffee pot. I also often want a second cup later in the morning and don’t feel like making another cup. My husband hates hot coffee and I only drink my coffee hot so he’s been buying his iced coffee at a shop. Jot made it easy for both of us. Love it!,5

1419,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/07/2021,"Not gritty or grindy, easy to mix with milk or water and is very tasty.  So far big fan and is saving me time in the morning (not brewing/preparing cold brew, not going to a coffee shop) and also money",5
1420,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/07/2021,I was a little nervous to purchase because I was afraid it wouldn't be worth the money and I was so happy that I did! Jot is really a delicious cup of coffee and so convenient. I mix mine with oat milk iced and it is hard to stop at two cups. Definitely worth the purchase!,5
1421,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/07/2021,"I love Jot!!! I especially like the Dark because it's smooth and has a nutty flavor, not too acidic. I like to have mine with oat milk. It saves so much time and money.",5
1422,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/07/2021,After reading the reviews I could not wait to get my order. After trying this I was less than impressed. It was expensive and tasted like my instant coffee that I already have that I get for 12 dollars at Sams Club. Not sure if this is the normal but the bottle I have used so far is not very good.,3
1423,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/07/2021,"HOW you have created such an amazing product, I do not know. But y'all get me through my classes and late night projects. Rock on!",5

Would like it more if it were fair-trade and organic, but it is definitely super handy to have in our van/RV where we only have access to a kettle to boil water. Much better taste than most instant coffees I've tried. Will definitely buy again, but please use fair-trade beans!",5
1425,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/07/2021,I love that I can have a delicious iced coffee whenever I want and as strong as I want. Add oat milk and vanilla and you have a wonderful delicious iced vanilla coffee. And at a fraction of a coffee shop price.,5

But, around 11am, I need a pick me up.  Jot is PERFECT.  I mix it with lactose-free milk, and then add ice at work, and it’s a great tasting jolt of energy to get through my afternoon.  Highly recommended.",5

1431,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/07/2021,"I have never liked coffee. But after I had covid, my tastebuds changed completely. I saw this ad and decided to try it and my oh my I’m so glad I did!! My boyfriend and I were amazed at how much we actually like this! The caffeine boost is just what we need! I got the regular and my boyfriend got the dark. With every glass we like it a little bit more. We drink it on ice with 3 parts vanilla almond milk and one part sweet cream coconut creamer. So yummy!!",5
1432,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/07/2021,I was pretty skeptical about this so only ordered 2 bottles to test it out.  First time I tried it with a premiere protein vanilla shake and added a tablespoon of Jot and I’m hooked.  Even my husband said it was good 😊,5
1433,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/07/2021,"This Jot is great stuff! Typically I drink hot coffee neat. Try and stay off the sugar crack ya know. For the cold ice Jot found it very enjoyable. I used an organic Almond coconut vanilla blend. Ridiculously delicious!
In addition use alkalized water  to be more profound. Great stuff!
Thx for your offer ! A real win would be to include the portion spoon. 
Definitely will use the discount towards that. 
-MAS",5
1434,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/07/2021,I was impressed when I took my first sip. It was the smoothest cold brew I’ve tried and I have tried tons. I love this coffee and company!,5
1435,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/07/2021,I tried Jot to see if this quick coffee solution would keep my morning brief and shine. It works well! It tastes good as well.,5
1436,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/07/2021,"First it’s so convenient, I’m not patient waiting for my coffee to brew. I’m still asleep, standing, waiting, willing for it to brew faster!! Well no more. Not is super convenient and tastes great!! I love being able to be plain or dress it up.",5
1437,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/07/2021,"Better than I thought it would be! Rich flavor, nice undertones. Will definitely order again",5
1438,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/07/2021,"I was skeptical about how good this would be, but it did live up to the hype. My only complaint is, that for a coffee drinker like me, it isn't as cost effective as  I thought it would be. It is as promised 14 cups for a bottle, but I drink way more coffee than the bottle gives me versus a bag of grounds. AGAIN, the coffee is phenomenal, smooth and rich just like advertised. I can see myself buying it again as a treat to have once or twice a week, but it can't replace my ground coffee.",5
1439,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/07/2021,"I have to have my coffee every morning. We have a highly rated coffee maker that makes a decent brew! But on the morning I want an iced coffee, I felt SOL. I really didn't think I would like Jot as much as I do. Hot, Cold, Creamer, Black, with Almond Milk, with Cow's Milk, there is no limit! I'm a converted for sure!",5
1440,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/07/2021,Loved it! So good!,5
1441,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/07/2021,Jot coffee is delicious and so easy to make into any kind of morning beverage!,5
1442,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/07/2021,"As a huge fan of iced coffee, Jot makes it easy to always have access to cold caffeine without having to refrigerate drip coffee or make (and sometimes if I plan poorly, wait for) cold brew. 
Anecdotally, I love the squeak of the cork when I take the stopper out, I feel like I’m working with potions.",5
1443,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/07/2021,"Really enjoying my Jot.  Very quick to make and smooth.  It takes a little time to figure out the right proportions of cream/water/Jot, but when you do, A+.",5
1444,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/07/2021,Have enjoyed so far,5
1445,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/07/2021,First time and not the last time! SOOOOOO GOOD! Definitely a household fave a way cheaper than buying the $5-$6 Starbucks plus you can make it how you like! The options are endless! Don’t sleep on it! Trust!,5
1446,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/07/2021,Smooth and quick to make! Will order again!,5

1448,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/07/2021,"Love this coffee so much! The taste is so rich...hard to believe it's not freshly brewed! I have so far only opened and tried the dark, but I'm sure the regular will be just as flavorful!",5
1449,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/07/2021,I really loved this because I appreciate the fact I don’t have to heat it up to make iced coffee.,5
1450,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/07/2021,Jot delivers an exceptional cup of smooth coffee. It is quick and easy. I especially enjoy using it in steamed milk.,5
1451,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/07/2021,"I typically don’t write reviews unless I really like the product but this one is worth every penny, I even share and had my friends try it. We really love the Dark version. Keep it up!",5
1452,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/07/2021,I LOVE Jot coffee. It’s perfect for an on-the-go guy like me who is constantly doing something. It’s convenient and super smooth.,4
1453,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/06/2021,"I was a bit skeptical of a coffee concentrate, but I absolutely love a good iced coffee. This is so customizable and wonderful, I don’t think I’ll ever go back to my local shop. Jot Dark was my favorite of the two since I like a stronger cup of coffee. Mixing with 6oz water and 1tablespoon Jot and ice is just right. If you’re thinking about switching, it’s worth it!",5
1454,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/06/2021,Taste delicious.  Better than I expected. Will buy again. Thank you.,5
1455,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/06/2021,I normally brew my coffee with an aeropress which takes some time and work. Jot tastes incredible and makes creating any coffee drink quick and easy!,5
1456,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/06/2021,So excited to get this product. Tried for the first time today and the scent is intoxicating. Will Have to work on measurements to make a yummy cup. Looking forward to trying the dark.,4
1457,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/06/2021,"I just finished my first bottle of Jot and will definitely be ordering more! I’m a flight attendant and use Jot as a replacement for the gross, weak hotel room coffee. Also saving lots from buying expensive airport coffee. It is a game changer!",5
1458,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/06/2021,Smooth flavor. Mornings ice coffee are so easy.,4
1459,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/06/2021,Jot brought back my love for coffee!!  Hot or cold...perfect cup every time!,5
1460,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/06/2021,Great pick me up in the afternoon. I pre-mix with milk and added a splash of creamer.,5
1461,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/06/2021,"I was initially skeptical trying jot, as I’ve been making coffee via French press and pour over for years. After trying it, it’s definitely a coffee that I see myself adding to my routine. It takes the time out of waiting and certainly tastes like good coffee! It’s great for keeping at the office for a mid-morning boost or to bring camping.",4
1462,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/06/2021,"Look- I hate coffee. I only drink it when there are no other sources of caffeine. IF I drink coffee, there's enough sugar in it to **** a diabetic. A friend pressured me to order from y'all, to get me off the normal soldier diet of Monster Energy Drinks. 1 tablespoon in 8 ounces of cold whole milk inside the nice little mug y'all sold…. I'm hooked. I never knew coffee could taste good. Thank y'all for a quality product.",5
1463,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/06/2021,"Loved the taste, shared with my father who is a big coffee drinker and he’s a fan now too!",5
1464,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/06/2021,I am so impressed by everything! The coffee is delicious and customer service is incredible. 10 out of 10 would recommend!,5
1465,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/06/2021,"I am no sales person..nor sponsored. However, this stuff is gold! No more waiting in lines of the drive through to get your coffee order. (That half the time ends up being the wrong order!) Just add water (hot or ice) one tbs of the Jot ultra coffee and milk/cream. This literally takes me under a minute, to make every morning. 🙏🏻☕😍🎉🎉",5
1466,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/06/2021,I was intrigued when I saw this and figured I would give it a shot! I thought it will at least he my quick go to coffee before work and I actually fell in love with it! I don’t use my Nespresso anymore. I’ve been on an iced pumpkin coffee kick and this is honestly better than Starbucks!,5
1467,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/06/2021,I used to live at Coffee shops but this has allowed me to venture out more or even stay home. It’s perfect as an iced oat latte as well.,5
1468,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/06/2021,"I was skeptical before buying this because I thought it was all hype! I’m glad I eventually tried it because I love it! It tastes great (I was expecting way worse). It keeps me caffeinated for my 12 hr shifts and I’m addicted to caffeine so that’s saying a lot. If you’re on the fence about it, go for it!",5
1469,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/06/2021,"I’ve become more sensitive to caffeine (especially from Starbucks), but I love the flavor of coffee. I tried this on a lark, and it even came with a cool insulated mug. This coffee is amazing, I’ve started with 1/2 TB and and it still taste rich and delicious. My sensitivity is reduced to this method of extraction.",5

1471,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/06/2021,"First of all: Jot is tasty. Absolutely no sourness or extreme bitterness - just excellent coffee flavor. Seriously, if you like coffee, you’ll love Jot. Second: Wow! One tablespoon pops my brain AWAKE in the morning! Overall: great, easy to make, quality coffee - I love it!",5
1472,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/06/2021,Jot has genuinely saved me so much money. I was spending $6 a day at a cafe near my job. Now I can bring my own coffee that actually tastes good. 💚,5
1473,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/06/2021,This will be the coffee I stick to forever. I have tried other concentrates.. that start with “J” and they were good but bitter. I have only tried the original version so far but I am ecstatic. I can drink this black and I am not generally a black coffee drinker.,5
1474,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/06/2021,My family and I all enjoy both the regular and dark. Convenient and great tasting. Will buy again!,5
1475,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/06/2021,I wasn’t an iced coffee drinker until I tried Jot. Now I wake up looking forward to having a cup.,5
1476,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/06/2021,I ordered a 1 each of the original and dark. Both are extremely smooth and very easy to make. I will definitely repurchase more in the future.,5
1477,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/06/2021,We have a one year old who we do everything we can to avoid waking up in the morning and there are just too many noisy options for coffee. Hot has allowed me to enjoy great tasting coffee while being as stealthy as possible. I'd highly recommend it for anyone wanting a fast and easy option without sacrificing quality.,5
1478,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/06/2021,Not tastes fantastic and is easy to make! That is all,5
1479,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/05/2021,This coffee tastes great!!! I love how fast and easy it is to make! Top quality product even down to the packaging.,5
1480,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/05/2021,I LOVE coffee as a FT WFH mom who homeschools and is the taxi cab to all activites I live on coffee (but I'm super picky) and Jot TOTALLY passed the test!!! I've tried a few other concentrated coffee brands and this one has been the best hands down!!! I'm looking forward to trying the Dark!! I've already gifted a couple bottles and made believers and new customers outnof several friends and family members!!,5

1482,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/05/2021,"Great taste,  so smooth, so easy!! Hassle free way to make coffee, hot or iced. Justvas good as fresh brewed coffee, if not better!! GET SOME!!",5
1483,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/05/2021,"My first cup was almost unbearably bitter. I measured it out with the teaspoon but it was overwhelming. I just kept having to add half and half to cut it. After a few more tries I managed to settle on about 1 and 1/3 tablespoon for a 16-oz cup of coffee. It was a nice convenience to make my morning routine a little quicker, not having to grind the beans or wait for my pour-over to settle. I’ll probably go back to beans after I finish this batch, just because the cost per cup doesn’t quite measure up to a Costco bag of beans, even organic beans.",3
1484,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/05/2021,Now I can’t drink any other cold brew concentrate. It’s just not near as good as Jot!,5
1485,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/05/2021,"TL;DR Version:
I love it. 

Full review:
I got the starter pack which includes one original flavor, one bold flavor, and a free travel mug. The mug is now my go-to travel mug, but we’re not here to talk about mugs, we’re here for coffee talk. For my first try I had both flavors black (with the recommended eight ounces of water) and they both are great that way. I have also tried them both with anywhere from a splash of milk to full on latte style and each way I do it it’s delicious!! After I leave this review I’m going to sign up for a subscription because it’s cheaper that way, but more importantly, I don’t want to run out!!",5
1486,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/05/2021,This coffee is soooooo yummy! Way better then Starbucks or anything else. I love it. I will definitely be ordering more.,5
1487,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/05/2021,"I’ve been in the market for a coldbrew for a while. Out of all the brands I’ve tried this has to be the best tasting coldbrew I’ve tried. On days that I’m really busy I’ll prep a few bottles in advance. Surprisingly that did not take away the taste, it tastes just as good as it would if I drink it immediately.",5
1488,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/05/2021,It was fantastic! Easy to travel with and strong taste!,5
1489,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/05/2021,"This is the smoothest coffee ever! I drink mine black so I drank it that way the 1st week. then I tried the latte, almond milk only next and perfectly strong enough that it didn't take away from the coffee taste. My new fave!",5
1490,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/05/2021,"I was hesitant at first to order coffee online but I’m so glad I did! This coffee is delicious!!! Jot’s customer service department is also very helpful. An item was omitted from my order, I contacted customer support and the item was shipped the next day!",5
1491,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/05/2021,As a daily Starbucks customer I was nervous to try this. I am very pleased with the flavor of both the regular and the dark. I do think I like the dark just a little bit better. I will keep buying this product. Thank you Jot.,5
1492,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/05/2021,Cheaper then going out. Easier to make at home. Very customizable.,5
1493,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/05/2021,i am a very lazy person who nonetheless likes to have fancy delicious iced coffee in the morning. jot is great! tastes amazing and saves me $5+ that i would have spent buying from a cafe.,5
1494,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/05/2021,I love jot! It really does pack a lunch in that one tablespoon of concentrate. I like to make an iced coffee to go with a little sweet cream. It’s perfect!,5

1497,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/05/2021,This has made my mornings so much smoother and enjoyable. I love the flavor and so far I've only been drinking it as iced coffee or lattes but I can't wait to make some hot drinks.,5
1498,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/05/2021,The coffee packaging itself was good and not damaged but one of the bottles was a bit sticky and the other had the labeling with the instruction writing rubbed off. I love the energy and positivity the Jot company puts out into the word and the coffee is good. I just don't think it's worth the expense. A cup from a quick and easy standard coffee pot at home is just as good.,3
1499,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/05/2021,After trying a lot of so-called store-bought concentrates and cold brews I absolutely love Jott and was born away at how fresh tasting it is,5
1500,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/05/2021,"It’s definitely an improvement over Folgers instant coffee, but really it’s an experience of its own. Paired with the Fellow no-spill cup, it’s a wonderful experience. I do** think it’s a little absurd they charge for the tablespoon — if you’re buying a subscription, I think they can probably afford to throw in a $3 metal spoon for measuring. That said, if you have your own measuring tool, it’s really easy. I make coffee in about 30 seconds (iced) and about a minute (hot, with an electric kettle). It’s consistently good every time, and it can really be made as strong as you’d like. The price point is justtttttt at the edge of affordable, but it’s more expensive than a bag of coffee so that may be a deal breaker for some. It rivals the cometeer experience for sure. Worth a try for those that want to up their instant coffee game.",5
1501,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original (Extra Bottle),10/05/2021,A bottle of happiness,5
1502,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/05/2021,"This little bottle contains the best iced coffee, hot lattes, and soon to be hot coffee. I can’t wait for the next bottle.",5
1503,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/05/2021,I made my first iced coffee within 20 minutes of my bottles being delivered. The taste is incredible!!! Safe to say I am now obsessed. I will continue to buy it!,5

JOT has an amazing taste, easy to use and has saved me a lot of money on ice coffee.  Will defiantly order again.",5

1508,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/04/2021,Where have you been all of my coffee drinking life? My first cup was gone before I realized it because I was not able to sip it slowly. My coffee maker and my cold brew pitcher are going to be jealous.,5
1509,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/04/2021,"Big dang fan!!! 

Tried this on a whim.  Was very, NOT disappointed!!!  

I've tried it hot black, iced black and with my go to, iced heavy cream...  really chowy and excellent all they way around.

I'll be back fomo!!!",5
1510,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/04/2021,"I love how quick and easy it is. Equally as important, I love the taste. It is so smooth. I do not feel the need to add milk, cream or sugar. I drank my coffee hot most of the time, but I loving Jot iced. It is the best cold coffee I have tried. It is also great hot, either way I am hooked.",5
1511,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/04/2021,"Not going to lie, I was a bit skeptical when I first came across Jot. I was looking for a way to save some money on coffee but still have a very great product. Jot is the answer! With just a tablespoon of coffee added to water and ice, I have an easy and delicious morning coffee!",5
1512,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original (Trial),10/04/2021,Love adding this to my shake so I'm not feeling too full from having both drinks for breakfast.  I get the taste of the coffee along with the caramel shake that is very flavorful and not bitter at all.  I think I will continue to use this in my weight loss journey.,5
1513,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/04/2021,"I have a toddler and a newborn and this has been essential. When I need coffee I don’t have the time or energy to brew coffee so I grab my jot and make an iced 
coffee or a latte right away. It’s been a lifesaver.",5
1514,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/04/2021,"And I liked it very much - so she ordered some for me. When I came back home, this coffee was waiting for me. I have some stomach issues and am very careful selecting coffee. This coffee is so smooth (I am using less than what you suggested), and no stomach issues! I am hooked!",5
1515,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/04/2021,"To be honest, I have been thinking about ordering jot for a while now but I was nervous that I if I didn’t like it I would regret spending the money. There was a first time offer and decided that it was time! I made myself a latte with provided instructions and it was SO delicious and smooth. I’m usually someone who orders Starbucks way too much, but this was way less bitter and much more flavorful. Please come out with a larger version!!",5
1516,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/04/2021,"Just as the title states, Jot was delicious and very easy and quick to work with. Will definitely be purchasing more.",5
1517,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/04/2021,I was curious about Jot and how exactly it would taste but I’ve had several cups which I have made a variety of different ways. I have to say I am impressed and will likely become a regular customer. I would recommend it to anyone especially if you like iced coffees or mixing up your own concoctions. So far it really is good with just about anything!,5
1518,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/04/2021,"I love a glass of iced coffee in the morning, and Jot really made it so easy to make myself a glass without having to worry about constantly making a batch of cold brew to steep overnight.

1522,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/04/2021,I gave Jot as a gift to our daughter who is in college. She said Jot is a life saver and SO GOOD! Thank you!!,5
1523,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/04/2021,This coffee tastes like no other. It is so smooth and sooooo convenient. Coffee ready in less than a minute. I’m in love!!,5

1525,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/04/2021,This has been my favorite instant coffee option out there so far. So much better to have a bottle of this at the office instead of gross K cups. Best alternative out there.,4

1529,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/04/2021,"I must admit I was a bit hesitant to drop 40+ $ on a potentially terrible cup of coffee. Boy was I glad I did, the coffee is tremendously good. My fellow cup does leak a little though but that is nothing to do with the quality of the coffee. 10/10 would and have recommended to family and friends.",5
1530,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/04/2021,Tried it with oat milk and really liked the taste. The original is a little weaker than I’d like but I avoid adding more than a tbsp because of the caffeine content. I’ll have to try the dark version next.,5
1531,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/04/2021,It was a really smooth cup of coffee. Enjoying my first bottle!,5
1532,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/04/2021,I’ve made 5 different coffees so far and i love it! It takes 2 seconds in the morning to make and really does taste good! Best combo so far has been vanilla almond milk with a tablespoon of Jot! So Good!,5

1544,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/04/2021,Great coffee with subtle fruity notes. Most store bought concentrates I’ve tried usually have an artificial flavor but this one exceeded expectations. Only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because the price per bottle is too high for the amount. I get it’s a very concentrated premium coffee but $24 for a bottle is a bit steep.,4
1545,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/04/2021,"Pretty good but a little disappointed with the taste. Tasted like coffee flavor, like eating coffee ice cream. I think I should have gotten the dark one, probably would like that better.",3
1546,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/04/2021,"The coffee tasted sour. I Don't know if it was normal, but it was the first cup of Joe that was sour for me. I may try it again since I may have had a bad batch.",3

His mother also took my advice and ordered it to try. Definitely recommend this to everyone!",5
1551,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/04/2021,"I love this concept. I can get my caffeine without filling up on sugar, dairy products, or unnecessary water. I’m officially a believer!",5
1552,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/04/2021,"I decided to try this before splurging on an expensive espresso machine, because drip coffee doesn't do it for me, and icing it is a pain and takes too much ice, and by the time it's cold, it's all watered down. I'm so glad I did, because wow, this coffee is ACTUALLY DELICIOUS and so easy! I now keep a bottle of this and vanilla oatmilk in the fridge at work, and got my boss addicted too! No more office sludge for us!",5
1553,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/04/2021,Honestly wasn’t expecting much but I was pleasantly surprised. Mix 1-2 tablespoons with oat milk and I am good to go!,5

I knew just by the real coffee aroma when opening the bottle that this would be a wonderful cup of coffee.  It is so easy and convenient!  It takes a good coffee to be able to enjoy without cream or sugar and this is awesome enjoyed on its own.  I am subscribing so I always have on hand. :),5
1556,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/03/2021,I was tired of spending my hard earned money at Starbucks so often. So I thought I’d try this. Not disappointed. I can make great vanilla sweet cream cold brew lattes and forgo any taste!,5

1562,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/03/2021,"I’m a coffee snob.  Never thought a concentrated coffee would be so clean tasting, no weird taste, just a clean perfect cup.    Couldn’t get any easier than 1 tbsp in your cup, add anything as you like!  The cup that came with it keeps your coffee cold forever!- never lasts that long though.",5
1563,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/03/2021,"I decided to purchase a bottle of Jot to make some iced coffee. It only took one big sip which immediately turned into having one or two everyday. I added unsweetened vanilla almond milk, some splashes of chocolate almond milk and some sweetener to the tablespoon of Jot. I really was shocked that it tasted better than any other iced coffee. Last week I had to go several days until my order came and was very unhappy that I hadn’t order more right away. I then signed up for automatic delivery.",5

1568,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/03/2021,I love it - I would drink it everyday but it’s too pricey for me. It is easy to use and fast great coffee. Tastes amazing in my protein shake too. This will be something I purchase every once in a while for a special treat.,5
1569,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/03/2021,I love this stuff. It’s so smooth and easy to make! The only thing- just use a measuring spoon or else you’ll have too much and feel like you’re running on jet fuel…,5
1570,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/03/2021,Wow! This is so good! I’ve tried other coffee concentrate options but this one really hits the mark on flavor!,5
1571,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/03/2021,Tried out the duo and it was ****** easy to make a latte that tasted just like the ones I was paying $6 for at my local coffee shop.,5
1572,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/03/2021,Great coffee and simple to prepare! This has made my mornings simplistic and I feel more energy throughout the day.,5
1573,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/03/2021,If you want the perfect temperature in a cup of coffee every time this is for you. The taste is also incredible. I’m in love with this concept. Super easy and no clean up. I’ve been using it every morning but I originally thought it would be awesome for traveling or camping. Thank you for creating this and thank you for making it organic and delicious.,5
1574,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/03/2021,"I love protein shakes in the morning. JOT is the perfect addition to my shakes to give it that smooth coffee flavor before heading out the door!

1576,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/03/2021,I bought 2 bottles and received them about a week ago. My coffee routine is forever changed. I love it. My first bottle is nearly gone. It was so much more amazing than I’d hoped!,5
1577,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/03/2021,This coffee is incredible and one bottle lasts me at least 2 weeks. So easy easy to make in the morning while running out the door! The added white matte travel coffee mug is very sleek too!,5

It's so easy to make an amazing cup of coffee! Not only am I saving money by skipping the coffee shop in the morning, but I am getting the best tasting coffee out there! Jot makes my morning so much easier and also mighty tasty! Fantastic!",5
1579,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/03/2021,"I’ve enjoyed it so far due to the convenience. However, improvements could be made to the flavor it seems that with measuring 1tbsp with 8oz of wager or milk the coffee flavor is rather weak. I understand that is a personal preference though and can be adjusted to taste. But my concern is caffeine content. If one 1tbsp has about 150mg of caffeine I would enjoy a stronger flavor for that equivalent caffeine content. I also noticed that on days I had Jot as opposed to my usual Nespresso, I would develop a caffeine withdrawal headache in the afternoon which has me believe that it contains less caffeine per tbsp then indicated. Overall I enjoy the product but would enjoy a more robust flavor per said caffeine content.",3
1580,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/03/2021,This has become a family favorite!,5
1581,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/02/2021,Great tasting coffee,5

1583,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/02/2021,"This coffee has quickly become my new favorite. I prefer it to Dunkin or Starbucks coffee now - its become my new standard to uphold other coffees too. I have not tried it hot yet, but the iced coffee is my go to! On the plus side I have also saved a ton on my daily coffee stops!",5
1584,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/02/2021,"I have been brewing my own cold brew for over a year. I didn’t know what I was missing out on until I tried Jot!!! Seriously THE best coffee! Better than what you can get from any major coffee shop! Plus is WAY more affordable! If you’re hesitant, don’t be! You will not regret this purchase!!!",5
1585,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/02/2021,Very smooth and satisfying coffee. Not overpowering either. Although I wish I had a promotion for the free measuring spoon. I think I shoulda waited for the promotion I once saw.,5
1586,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/02/2021,These make the perfect iced coffee to take with me work every morning! It's just enough caffeine to help me survive the day & it's super easy. I'm definitely obsessed with this product.,5

Yummy",5
1588,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/02/2021,I have 5am shifts and everyone in the house is asleep still when I wake up to get ready. So I can’t brew my cup of coffee to wake me up. This has been an amazing solution to my little problem. I Can now quietly prepare my coffee in less then two minutes and flavor it however I want. Thank you Jot!,5

1590,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/02/2021,"Hi Andrew,

I am an avid coffee drinker that is always trying various cold brews, grinds, etc. Jot is easily at the top of the list. I like the sharpness and bitterness it carries as well as it smoothness. The only thing is it takes two or three for it to really hit me! Might be how much I drink though! Thank you for a high-quality product!",5
1591,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/02/2021,"I poured 1 tablespoon into the travel mug I also purchased from JOT. Mixed about 5oz of water with ice and some creamer. WOW! I am in heaven. The robust flavor and strength of the coffee has me very happy. I am a coffee fiend and I am very particular with the taste and strength, needless to say I am very impressed and happy with my purchase and will be ordering more JOT soon.",5
1592,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/02/2021,"I'm not much for reviews, never done one, but this stuff far surpassed any and all expectations.  I literally couldn't ask for any more in my coffee.  I work in a factory, and after a long day I want a coffee, but I don't want it hot and I don't want to bother making a hot coffee iced.  This is the absolute perfect solution, thank you.",5

1599,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/02/2021,This coffee is so flavorful. It's robust and deep without the bitterness you would expect to find in a bottled coffee. I love the mug that I got with it the splash guard is a lifesaver while drinking a cold cup with ice cubes. There is nothing worse then getting splashed in the face with a beverage because the ice cubes slid forward too fast.,5
1600,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/02/2021,It was delicious and satisfying!!!!!,5
1601,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/02/2021,WOW!! As a barista I am a self proclaimed coffee snob who loves to start the morning with a fresh cup! Sometimes with a full life making a pour over or french press is not the most time efficient! I love Jot for the simplicity but I adore the full body taste that all comes from 1 TBL of concentrate!! Recommending this to literally everyone!! So convenient and delicious. 10 out of 5 stars!,5

1603,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/02/2021,"Best coffee concentrate I’ve tried. It has a clean finish, not bitter or burnt like some concentrates. Buying Jot has saved me a ton of money already by making iced coffee at home.",5
1604,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/02/2021,"We love making our own cold brew but since having a baby 7 months ago we rarely find the time. I’m so glad we decided to try Jot because it’s delicious and SO easy and the cost actually works out to less than anything else we’ve tried. I love making mine into an iced latte, my hubs makes his into a coffee protein shake. And yes a tablespoon is REALLY all you need! Signing up for a subscription now!",5
1605,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,10/02/2021,Great for a little pep in the morning. It tastes great with some FairLife milk and a splash of Oat milk creamer with ice.,5
1606,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/02/2021,I am definitely enjoying my bottle of jot coffee. It’s so quick n easy to make a cup or glass of coffee. Looking forward to making these special drinks with the recipes provided.  I was hesitant but the coffee flavor and taste is there…I am glad I decided to give it a try.,5
1607,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/02/2021,"I can see why some people would love this coffee concentrate but because I drink my coffee black and tend to have a more sensitive palate, I thought it was slightly too bitter. I’ve only made iced coffee with this so I’m not sure how it will taste hot, but I’m guessing it will probably still have that oily taste. It’s not at all horrible, it’s just not my favorite. I’ve had other coffee concentrates that had no bitterness, so I think I’ll stick to that brand, but I won’t have any issues finishing my two orders of this. Overall, I think it’s really up to what you’re looking for in your coffee drink - if you don’t mind the bitterness when it’s black or if you use sweeteners/creamers, you should be able to mask that flavor easily and enjoy the ease (just add water!)",3
1608,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/02/2021,It’s great!!! My wife and I love it. Fast for when we’re in a rush or even just to give a cup of regular coffee a boost of caffeine. I do two tablespoons over water/ice and a dash of creamer!!!,5
1609,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/02/2021,"Don’t love the flavor, but it is far superior to instant powdered coffee. Also AMAZING for cooking, alcoholic cocktails, and smoothies.",3
1610,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/02/2021,The flavor of this is better than any coffee shop or commercial coffee company.  A little goes a long way!  Makes my day much smoother not waiting in long lines.,5
1611,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/02/2021,"Fist off, what great customers service ! This alone makes this brand 5 stars ! Everyone at my job were so curious to try JOT and it was hard to share and not share since I wanted to spread the word of how amazing this product is ! The one thing I also love about it aside from the taste is the control I have. I’m not a huge coffee drinker so I can mix a bit more water to dilute it and still have that great taste. I’m actually baffled at this creation! Also, I don’t have a coffee machine at work so this is ideal ! So happy I purchased this!",5
1612,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/02/2021,"Guys, this is great concentrate! It’s got a deep rich flavor, tinge of healthy bitterness, and a nice backend kick with the caffeine content. I’m a fan for sure but have to be honest it’s not cold enough outside for hot coffee so this 5 star rating is for the iced coffee and iced latte recipes! Also have to admit one of my fav recipes was at the Baskin Robbins Dunkin’ Donuts it was called a brownie capachino blast, I’m going to try mixing a couple shots of jot, some brownies, some milk and ice cream and finish it with a whip cream and cinnamon powder… I’ll let ya know how it goes",5
1613,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/02/2021,This is aaahhh-maze-ing!! I didn't think 1 tbsp would be enough but boy is it! I even added a bit more water. Small amt goes a long way! Very versatile 👌 👏,5

1624,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/01/2021,"I LOVE JOT! Wish I had tried it sooner. The best part is how easy it is with the one tablespoon added to water and then ice and cream and sugar, if that’s how you like it. I was skeptical at first about the taste but Ultra is delicious, with or without cream. Also, I like how it’s JUST coffee with no added preservatives or chemicals, which is very important to me. So glad I’m on the Jot wagon, I’m never getting off lol.",5

Needless to say, I will be a returning customer and I would highly recommend.",5
1627,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/01/2021,I was skeptical at first but the convenience factor really won me over and it was totally worth it! I can make a cup of iced coffee in 30 seconds and it is as good or better than any of my machines. One tablespoon is really all you need and if you need more of a shot two is still just as smooth. The flavor is what was most surprising as it has a nice finish and rivals any big chain. No more worries of burned or over heated/old beans. My wife and I love it!,5
1628,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/01/2021,JOT makes the smoothest cold brew I have ever tasted. There is no way I am going back to any other iced coffee! Only JOT for me!,5

I am so excited for the money and time I am going to save… No more needing to go to the coffee shop every day!,5

It’s smooth just can’t exactly put a finger on it but it seems to lack taste memory",4

1658,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/29/2021,"I really really love Jot! The Original is seriously so smooth and delicious. The Dark is a bit more bitter than I enjoy personally, but I can see how true coffee aficionados could appreciate  it. The packaging is really well done. The outside of my box was damaged but inside everything was so snug/safe and secure! I love the added touch of seasonal recipe cards and look forward to collecting a bunch. As cheesy as it sounds I really do get excited thinking about the next days cup of coffee. I love mine iced! The only drawback possibly is getting into the mindset of portioning out each drink. The recommended serving size is 8 ounces (with water included ). But it does seem to be true that you really don’t need as much, compared to say normal iced coffee.

Also the customer service and company as a whole are superior.",5

Excellent over ice.",5
1660,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/29/2021,I would absolutely recommend this product! It is impossible to find organic coffee at the stands here in my town and I love that I can make an amazing-tasting sugar-free mocha with almond/coconut creamer in less than 3 minutes before heading to work! The cost of those drinks is less than $2 a piece and I’m the past I was spending approximately $5 or more at the coffee stands. I also take the Jot bottle with me and have a second cup of black coffee halfway through my shift. It tastes great with just 8 oz of hot water added. It is very rich and smooth- and so convenient! Well worth it and my favorite new thing that I’ve discovered!,5

I am still trying to adjust to my preferred taste as I like my coffee strong. But this product is definitely a winner and I will be purchasing more.",5
1663,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/29/2021,Instagram just wouldn’t stop promoting it to me and it was a total hit. Good job with those ads! I am truly enjoy my coffee in the morning and for lunch. So many options on how to make a great iced or hot cup of coffee. Believe the hype! Try it!,5
1664,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/29/2021,I prefer ice coffee but I’m lazy and making ice coffee is more difficult than making a pot of coffee! Jot is so easy to use and makes perfect ice coffee every time!,5

1667,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/29/2021,"Have been drinking Jot almost daily. It's suuuuuuuuuuper convenient. Haven't tried it hot yet, but makes pretty good iced coffee. Probably a little pricier than just making beans but the convenience is worth it. I got the bundle with the fellow mug and I love that too!",4
1668,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/29/2021,"I just started using Jot.  I am a daily cold brew drinker and this has been a game changer!  Making my drink every morning is easier, faster, and most importantly, it is AMAZINGLY tasty!!!",5

1671,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/29/2021,Really great tasting coffee at affordable prices. It's also very convenient and easy to make. No more coffee runs in the morning for us.,5
1672,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/29/2021,"I’m somewhat of a coffee snob and was fully prepared to dislike Jot. For context, I’ve tried Keurig pods, instant powdered coffee, and canned lattes and haven’t found anything as good as my Bialetti mocha pot in terms of flavor. Jot is BY FAR the best « instant » coffee out there (if you can call it that). It’s honestly as good as fresh coffee but so much faster!!",5
1673,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/29/2021,The gents in our Boulder office LOVE JOT! We have a small group of people there so this format works well for them and the quality is excellent! Great product!,5
1674,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/29/2021,I bought is on a whim not knowing what to expect. I ordered the two pack with dark roast and regular ultra concentrated coffees.

1675,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/29/2021,"Hello Andrew! As I continue to work from home, and need a quick coffee break now and then, Jot has been such an excellent addition to my caffeine game. I am so impressed with the quality of your product, but what really stands out to me is the quality of your customer service and attention to detail. I reached out to your Jot Customer Support a couple of times throughout this process. First, I needed to update my shipping address, and second, I had just one small item missing from my initial order (your lovely tablespoon). Angelique was so very kind and responsive, and helped me out through each step of the way. When I try a new product for the first time, it's the people and the interactions that always stand out to me, and Angelique was a joy to connect with. In the midst of this pandemic time, those connections and feeling both seen and heard can seem like a small thing, but it truly speaks volumes. 

Thanks very much for reaching out! This speaks volumes, as well! I took a business ethics course back in college. I was a geology major, and the only non-business student, but it was one of my very favorite courses I've ever taken. Your company stands out to me as one that truly cares about people. Thanks for such an excellent experience! I will certainly be coming back from more. :)",5
1676,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/29/2021,Smooth and delicious!  I’d definitely buy again.,5
1677,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/29/2021,"Love it. It’s rich, dark, flavorful and so smooth. Not bitter or acidic. Excellent as an iced coffee, very tasty warm. Versatile. I’ve used it in affogatos and espresso martinis, as well as cooking. This NEEDS to come in bulk sizes!",5
1678,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/29/2021,"This is a new thing for our company. Usually we buy the Starbucks cold brew bottles. But Jot was a billion times better. Seriously, you can really taste the coffee. It takes an extra minute to make than pouring from a bottle, but it’s worth it for the taste. We are sold.",5
1679,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/29/2021,"If there is one thing to say about this coffee it is simply that it is super smooth, no bitterness or acidic bite at all.",5
1680,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/29/2021,"I wasn’t a big coffee drinker, but I’ve recently found myself making coffee more and more. I don’t make the best coffee. I saw an ad about jot coffee and figured since I’m not the best coffee maker, nor do I drink it everyday, this would be perfect for me. Honestly, I didn’t expect it to be great. Well, it’s amazing!! I drink this coffee EVERYDAY!! Sometimes it’s the only thing I have for breakfast. I mainly make ice coffee. But whatever way you have it, it’s great! I’m not disappointed.",5

It literally takes under 5 minutes yo create a delicious coffee drink. But it very soon turned into a take it with you treat, and a late afternoon pick me up. There is no other way to explain our ""conversion"" other than to say that Jot is delicious coffee made without waste or hassle. By my family budget calculations, my husband and I have saved the cost of our first kit in just 8 days by not stopping for coffee on the way to work, during lunch break and various other coffee shop trips. We re-ordered, and will continue to reorder. Also, I can drink Jot without stomach issues -dont know why, maybe the process of its brewing- but it is not bitter or acidic tasting, and doesn't cause my stomach to be upset.",5
1683,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/29/2021,This is super easy and convenient to make in the mornings when I’m trying to prep breakfast and lunches for kiddos at the same time! Taste is great and replaces the latte I usually grab from Starbucks.,5
1684,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/29/2021,Quick and easy. Wish it had more of that coffee taste and more caffeine though,4
1685,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/29/2021,"I use Jot as an on-the-go quick grab on my way to the gym, or between meetings. So easy to make and has great flavor. Just as strong as freshly brewed coffee without the hassle. Highly recommend!",5

1688,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/28/2021,Jot is literally as good and in some cases better than my espresso machine. It all comes down to convenience for me. I just add cold tap water and 2 TSB of jot and thats my cup of coffee on the go at work!,5
1689,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/28/2021,"I finally tried Jot after their IG ad persistently followed me around for weeks... and I'm so glad I gave it a go! I'm an all-year-round iced coffee drinker, and Jot makes it SO easy to get my iced latte fix every day. Two bottles aren't going to last me very long, but only because I'm making myself multiple drinks a day!",5

I love that you can tweak it until you get it just the way you want it and that it's good cold and hot! I've hidden it from my teenagers because the little freeloaders will drink all of it and I love them enough to share a pot of Folgers, but not quite enough to share my JOT!",5
1695,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/28/2021,This coffee is so easy and delicious! I love it!,5

1699,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/28/2021,So I was not totally sure about this but thought I would give it a try and am glad I did. I did the original as I am not a fan of super strong coffee and it is really good. It has actually helped me stop going to the coffee shops as I can get a latte my way at home. Really good.,5
1700,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/28/2021,"I drink Jot mixed with milk and I love it! No bite, just deep almost chocolatey flavor.  I wish you made decaf so I could have more of it!",5

1707,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/28/2021,"I love an iced coffee in the afternoon, but it's less practical to go get one every day when working from home, and a lot of bottled iced coffees are expensive or filled with sugar. I like Jot because I can make it into whatever kind of drink I want, if it's a simple iced coffee, or an iced latte, add sweetener or not, etc. Its very easy to make and everything I've made with it tastes great. It is also very smooth, I get acid reflux with a lot of coffees, but Jot is super strong without having that acidic effect.",5

I first tried mixing one tablespoon with four to six ounces of water thinking I would just chug it down for the caffeine benefits, and not worry about the lack or milk and sugar, but to my surprise it was really good and unnecessary to add when in a pinch. Overall great product!",5
1713,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/28/2021,I was skeptical. Then I made an iced coffee....OMG! Love it....Thank You!,5

1715,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/28/2021,Good coffee but a bit expensive compared to other coffee concentrates,3
1716,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/28/2021,I completely stopped buying coffee after I subscribed to Jot. It's hard to explain but this is no ordinary coffee concentrate that tastes watered down. Every cup tastes fresh and strong--as you would get from any fancy coffee shop. And it couldn't be easier to make your favorite cup!!!,5
1717,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/28/2021,I’ve tried at least five varieties of concrete coffee & Jot tastes the best. Just finished my first bottle of it. My only hope is they sell it in a bigger bottle.,5

Jot, + my creamer in a to go cup in the fridge the night before, add hot water in the morning and I’m on my way out the door! It taste great. I’ve been a Folgers dark silk girl for Years.

1724,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/28/2021,"I originally ordered it because I was spending an obscene amount of money on iced coffee everyday and was looking to save-but this is even better. My go-to used to be an iced cappuccino from DD. With Jot-I make it with iced cold milk instead of coffee instead and it’s even better. For a sweet treat, I’ll top it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Seriously. I hate that I waited so long to try it. If you’re on the fence, just do it.",5

1731,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/28/2021,"The coffee tastes fine. I really like the idea of the concentrate for portability and environmental reasons. Compared to other cold brews, It’s not my favorite coffee and it’s on the pricy side. But it’s fine and I will keep a bottle on hand at work. Side note, I was disappointed with the quality of the tablespoon. On the website it looked pretty Sturdy, but It is pretty flimsy.",4
1732,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/28/2021,Favorite way to drink it is as a latte - so quick too!,5
1733,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/28/2021,"Ultra coffee is amazing. You know when you go to a coffee shop and they brew the perfect temp shots for your cappuccino and there isn't any bitterness? It's better than that. I was so surprised when I made my first coffee because it actually tasted like the perfect brew (I've only had that a few times but when you know, you know). I drank so much the first day that I was over caffinated! I originally bought Jot because I am so extremely caffeine sensitive but my job requires focus and can be extremely exhausting so, I needed something I had more control over. I hate thin, brown, coffee-water. I really like a bold flavor. I end up brewing a HUGE pot of very thick, concentrated, and strong coffee for the office and everyone complains about how strong I make it (mind you, being sensitive I usually drink only 4 oz of it and the crew is stuck with the pot) but I cannot stand flavorless coffee. I don't mind pot coffee, it's not the best but, it's not the worst. I simply can't bring myself to buy a tiny, child size coffee at a coffee shop that costs me several dollars when I am so caffeine sensitive that I can never finish my drink. With Jot, I have control over how much I want to make and the strength AND I don't have to compromise flavor. The bonus is that it's so smooth a bold, it tastes like a perfectly brewed shot every time and it's cheaper than a coffee shop. Even better, I don't have to waste anything :)",5
1734,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/28/2021,"I was rushing in the morning and no time to brew up a cup before work. I remembered that my Jot had delivered and was in the fridge. I filed my cup worth ice, vanilla flavored oat milk and a tablespoon of original Jot. To my amazement it was delicious! Every morning has been fun coming up with different ways of making my morning Jot.",5
1735,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/28/2021,"I have to admit, at first I was a skeptic. I ordered the two bottles of Jot and it came with two awesome glasses, per a special. Soon as I got the package I was eager to open and try it. I made my first drink as a cold brew, with creamer and milk along with a tablespoon of original brew.  The moment I took my first drink I was absolutely hooked. The taste is amazing and the smell of it is hypnotizing. Now this is my go to drink and to be honest I never really liked coffee. Mostly,I drank it to get a pick me up, before the gym. Well needless to say, I can’t stop drinking this coffee. I will be ordering much, much, more .  Finally a coffee that taste fantastic. No other coffee shop compares, and for the price, I’m all in. 
Thank you,
M.N",5
1736,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/28/2021,"I don’t like coffee. I have always tried to like it because so many people obsess over it and I’ve tried to see/understand the appeal. I tried Jot in my on-going effort to see if there’s a coffee I will ever like and… well now I like (this) coffee! I literally said, “yum!” after my first sip. I have been drinking the Original, but I have a bottle of Dark to try after this. I just mix it with 6-7 oz of soy milk and it’s amazing. I honestly look forward to being able to have it everyday- and it’s so easy. I don’t have to sweeten it, I don’t have to add anything but my milk. This also makes us very easy if you need to keep track of nutritional information because it’s really just what you’re pouring the Jot into. Give it a try!",5
1737,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/28/2021,Jot is by far my favorite Coffee concentrate yet. Perfect for cold brews and more. While it can’t 100% compete with my fresh ground and french pressed cup its an amazing alternative and way better than anything instant or pod based. Love it!,4

1741,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/28/2021,"The 1 Tbsp serving size seemed so small, I may have gone a tiny over in most of my cups… and wow does it wake you up! I like to mix it with milk and add a touch of creamer or stevia and think it tastes pretty good too, it reminds me of a (non concentrated) cold brew it just takes so much less and you can mix it to your liking. Ends up being cheaper than the other bottled cold brew we used to get too and the caffeinated wake up from it really stands out, so I’m loving Jot!",5

As a college student I never had time to make coffee in the morning and would always take to buying drinks at a cafe, and consequently spend way too much money on coffee. Jot is inexpensive and tastes like something I’d get at a boutique store.  I bought it for the convenience and stayed for the taste.",5

Only two things that would make this a 5 star review. I wish it came with a designated tablespoon, or possibly a measuring system integrated into the cap. Secondly it would be nice if there was some sort of refill option or more eco friendly system.",4

I originally bought the bundle for the free travel mug but now I’ll definitely be back to purchase more.",5
1755,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/27/2021,I’m an avid coffee drinker and so is my husband. I think he was more excited about my order.  I usually use a coffee press or Vietnamese Phin to make coffee but this is so simple and easy. It also allows him to make his own cup of coffee whenever he feels like it. The quality of the coffee is also really good. We will definitely be repeat customers.,5
1756,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/27/2021,Order arrived quickly!! Tastes great,5
1757,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/27/2021,"I always drink my coffee iced which when brewing a hot cup and putting ice cubes in only cools the coffee down. With Jot, I can have premium iced coffee faster than it would take to brew a k-cup.",5

I started doing ice coffees from the grocery store but they come in huge plastic bottles and I really wasn't into that.  Enter JOT!  I saw an ad on instagram and had to check it out.  I love that there is a regular and a dark version.  Loooove that they come in glass bottles.  Love that they can be used to make so many coffee drinks and of course, the biggest deal is that they are yummy.  I highly recommend Jot!",5

One suggestion, hope the mug can be sold separately.",5

1771,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/27/2021,"I tried this on a whim without expecting it to be very good, because I generally don't like pre-made or store bought coffee/cold brew. However, I was blown away. It tastes better than most coffee shop iced coffees, and I love that I can also add oat milk instead of water for more of a latte feel. I like my coffee strong so I do add more than the recommend 1 Tbs per 8 oz, so it's not quite as cost effective, but it's still a convenient and easy option for great iced coffee in the morning.",5
1772,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/27/2021,"I now have a new favorite go-to...Jot! It is so hard to get a consistent coffee from just about anywhere that isn't already charging $5+ for a cup, and even then it is either too acidic, too roasted, or may have just been sitting around for too long. So glad I found Jot!",5
1773,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/27/2021,"I was skeptical but decided to give it a try… my hubby loves the dark one, he said it’s smooth and not bitter like some other dark coffee. I prefer the regular as I’m usually a lighter blend drinker, it’s so good!!! The best part, I can do hot/cold by just adding whatever temperature water into it, faster than Keurig!! We’ll definitely reorder once our 1st bottles are finished. PS LOVE my freebie thermos!",5

I enjoy making the iced coffee with Jot and surprisingly it is quite strong and lots of caffeine. I was a little sad when I didn’t find a measuring spoon in the box, but that’s fine because I got a cool mug.",5

I disliked it so much that I can't bring myself to even try it again, you know, to give it another chance. I'm going to say that this is a failing on my part, because all the reviews I read beforehand raved about the flavor and perhaps my taste buds are not refined enough to appreciate a good cup of joe...",3

1829,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/25/2021,Jot’s really lit up my mornings since I live such a rushed life and making my coffee concoction is way faster than making a pot!,5
1830,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/25/2021,"It would be an understatement to say that law school changed my relationship with caffeine. I no longer see coffee as a pleasure so much as a necessity. Jot simplifies my coffee routine but also provides me with options--I love both the dark and the original varieties with hot water, ice water, almond milk, oat milk, whatever I'm in the mood for that day. Thank you, Jot, for helping me wake up in time for 8:30am property class. You're the best. 13/10, strongly recommend.",5
1831,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/25/2021,"Great taste and I’m enjoying my easy made flavorful ice coffee each day
Sherry",5

1833,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/25/2021,"I got this as a gift for my coffee loving hubby! I am not a coffee drinker because I’m very sensitive to caffeine and not fond of the taste. He normally just drinks hot coffee black but has recently gotten into cold brews. Using Jot is an easy way to make one and fast! Even bought a pumpkin spice oat milk creamer that tastes so yummy for fall season. I tried it too and actually liked it! Also, love the free insulated mug that came with my order.",5
1834,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/25/2021,I received my first two Jot bottles and love the smoothness and the taste of Jot. I read where you should swish the bottle before pouring a drink. I see so much of the product on the sides of the bottle and swishing and then aggressively shaking the bottle does not remove it from the sides. I am sure it was meant to ***** too but can't get it off the sides and I would say nearly 50% is coating the sides. Great tasting but not happy about this aspect of the product.,4
1835,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/24/2021,This stuff is the best.,5
1836,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/24/2021,"I had the dark with ice, skinny simple syrup and foamed cream on top and it was soooo good! I have been looking for a good mid-day at work coffee option and this is fabulous!",5
1837,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/24/2021,"So convenient, high quality, and DELICIOUS. Have recommended this to multiple people and am only a few cups in!",5
1838,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/24/2021,"As a single working mom, my ability to have and enjoy a good cup of coffee on the average chaotic morning is few and far between. Jot makes it easy for me to quickly make a quality cup of coffee I can enjoy while chasing around my little one.",5
1839,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/24/2021,"It tastes like coffee. It didn't change my life, it was just more convenient to bring on vacation than my brewing equipment.",3
1840,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/24/2021,Gets the party going! And by party I mean day. It’s very good cup of coffee and quick to go!,5
1841,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/24/2021,"This has been my godsend for iced coffee. I love it at home, but hate the process of making cold brew every couple of days. And the amount of room it would take up in my fridge to have a weeks worth of cold coffee was terrible. This has been the best tasting ice coffee I’ve had, and it’s so convenient! I won’t be going back, i love this product and have recommended it to everyone i know already",5
1842,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/24/2021,"I used to make a pour over every morning. As tasty as they were, they took a while and I didn’t feel like I always had the time. Now I almost exclusively use jot at home for my morning coffee! Quick & tastes great.",5
1843,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/24/2021,"JOT is super easy to make and has completely replaced my daily Starbucks runs (all that dough saved!). I enjoyed it so much, I made three cups my first day and well, it definitely works cause I didn't not sleep that night. 
I'd definitely recommend JOT to any of my friends/family.",5
1844,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/24/2021,"Love the smooth flavor, but I always feel nauseous and get cramps and stomach pains after drinking this coffee. Unfortunately, I am unable to order any more of it.",3
1845,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/24/2021,I’m sad that I am JUST now finding out about this! I’ve seen the pop ups about Jot but was afraid I wouldn’t like it. I took the leap and it has REPLACED my Starbucks runs. I LOVE this coffee,5
1846,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/24/2021,"Wow! I have to say, I know this sounds terrible but I bought Jot coffee because I simply just wanted the free fellow mug. The fellow mugs are anywhere from $25-$40 so it made sense to spend $50 and get the mug for free. I had low expectation but I am actually blown away. It is expensive so I don’t think this coffee is for someone with a strict budget but MY GOD ITS SO GOOD!! I have been trying it iced and hot and it’s delicious! It’s so easy and convenient and tastes so good that I find myself drinking TOO much! Haha I think if you are a time conscious person who is a lover of coffee and you have the money, BUY THIS!",5

1849,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/24/2021,i'd say just as good as the cold brew over at the local coffee shop.,5
1850,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/24/2021,"Jot is fantastic. I do not like standard drip, keurig or most other forms of convenient coffee, but sometimes I'm in a rush and don't have the time to make a pour over. Jot is convenient AND tastes good.

I'm traveling this weekend and taking some Jot with me in a smaller jar. I wish they sold a travel size that I could take on my carry on! Would love to have reliably good coffee when I travel.",5

1853,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/24/2021,"This stuff is not only delicious, it will also get you where you need to go. Having never tried it, I imagine the caffeine bump is similar to some sort of illegal upper. It’s potent, so don’t overdo it, but definitely do it.",5
1854,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/24/2021,It honestly taste like chemicals to me. I keep getting nauseated from it.,3
1855,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/24/2021,"I wanted to cut back on my $6/day coffee habit, and Jot has turned out to be the absolute best way to do that.

1858,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/24/2021,Love the original for my iced coffee (with a little oatmilk),5
1859,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/24/2021,I had seen Jot on IG and considered buying for months. You finally got me when you offered the free thermos when you buy 2 bottles (sucker for free coffee mugs). Now I’m hooked! I drink iced coffee every morning. So much better than Starbucks and I live that I’m not adding more plastic cups into the environment!! Get Jot now!,5
1860,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/24/2021,"My wife and I both have subscriptions and we just love the taste of the original and the ultra. Thank you for sharing and keep up the great work. This is by far the best coffee we have had. It is a great ""pick me up"".",5
1861,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/24/2021,I drink one cup first thing in the morning. I put a splash of oak milk and 8 oz of hot water. Gives me energy without the drop. Clean smooth taste and so easy to make!,5
1862,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/24/2021,I can't tell if the dark roast is as good as the original or the original is as good as the dark roast but aside from taste Jot has also made my morning routine hassle free as I don't have to deal with overly crowded coffee shops on my way to work. Why couldn't you have made this when I was in college is my only complaint.,5

1867,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/23/2021,I've tried a handful of concentrated cold-brew attempts in the past but they all miss the mark.  Jot ACTUALLY tastes like great coffee.  Imagine that?  Huge fan.  Thanks Jot!,5
1868,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/23/2021,"Honestly, this is so delicious and easy. TOO delicious and easy. I was on my 3rd cup yesterday and found myself wondering if there was a decaf option….so I could have a fourth 😳. Love this stuff!",5

1870,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/23/2021,Thought about how it was a bit pricey considering how much you get out of it (I live with 2 others who also love coffee so won’t last long) but it’s safe to say that they will need to buy their own bottles cause this is way to good to share sorry not sorry,5
1871,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/23/2021,Received two bottles of Jot and love it! So easy in the morning when I wake up and want a quick cup of coffee.,5

1879,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/23/2021,Just like it says you make your coffee how you like it. My first cup i added a tble spoon and half. Added a little sweetener then put the cap on and shook it. It tasted amazing. Not to strong and not a weak coffee flavor either. It was perfect. I'm definitely hooked.,5

1887,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/23/2021,"I love grinding and brewing a pot of coffee on a Saturday morning. Sitting and doing nothing for an hour. 

But Jot is my Go To for week day coffee. Pour 8 oz of hot water and stir in 1 tbsp of Jot and you are ready to rock the day! I am never late for anything anymore because I must have my coffee first. Joy allows me to pour and jet out the door.",5
1888,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/23/2021,Pleasantly surprised that it’s worth the hype! It’s so easy and GOOD - it’s as strong as they say it is!,5

I have had a cup of Iced Original with my normal creamer and while I have enough sugar for my tastes I can still get the flavors coming thru. I used to go for a huge cup 18 - 20oz but I make one Jot and I am all set! It’s so easy and it’s my new favorite thing! I can’t wait to try the Dark.",5

1910,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/22/2021,"My favorite way to drink this is over milk and ice. I’m a busy mom of three wild boys. Most mornings my coffee gets cold and gross before I have the chance to get to it. With Jot, I can splash some joy over cold milk and BAM! I’ve got some delicious coffee to help me chase down these boogers. It tastes so good even without a sweetener. I actually feel sad when I finish my cup, haha!",5

I was ready to take the plunge.
1st 3 cups make with iced with organic fat free milk and a stevia.
Today I bought low-fat oat milk as suggested in your pamphlet and had it iced without sweetener.
I have my 2 shots of Nespresso with hot foamy milk every morning b4 hopping in shower-after I make an iced coffee from organic camillion cold brew for my afternoon at work.
I now have my JOT “gold” to enjoy during my afternoon. I thank you for a wonderful product and ease of delivery.

1919,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/22/2021,I've been looking for the perfect at home solution to my daily local coffee house trip since the first week of quarantine in March 2020.

1927,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/21/2021,I loved this with oat milk! So good. I then tried it with just water (cold and hot) and did not like it. I’ll stick to my milk with it!,4
1928,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/21/2021,It took me two cups of coffee to figure out how I like it. Once that was done I have had great coffee ever since. I would encourage coffee lovers to try it.,5

1936,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/21/2021,This is the best instant coffee replacement I’ve found so far! Plus it’s just naturally sweet enough that I don’t need to add too much sugar which is always great.,5
1937,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/21/2021,Very smooth and enjoyable. Much better than canned brands or coffe house versions I am used to. Definitely a fan!,5
1938,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/21/2021,it works! and it tastes good too. Loving mixing it with seltzer and a squeeze of lemon. Or oat milk!,5
1939,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/21/2021,"Iced coffee in seconds, hooked… just buy it",5
1940,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/21/2021,This coffee is sooo good! So smooth and full of flavor! I'm so glad I finally tried it!,5
1941,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/21/2021,Cheaper than my McDons coffee. A lot better too.,5
1942,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/21/2021,I usually drink espresso and i was pleasantly surprised by jot. It has really good flavor and is nice and strong.,5
1943,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/21/2021,"I love being able to wake up, make an iced coffee at home, and not have to go anywhere! I love Jot and am HOOKED!",5
1944,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/21/2021,"I was skeptical about this, but after someone I followed on Instagram raved about it, I had to try it. It really is easy to make an iced coffee, and to my surprise, it tastes just as good - and dare I say even better - than the ones you get from the coffee shop! If you love coffee, this is worth a try! I can see myself reordering!",5
1945,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/21/2021,I’ve tried it hot and on ice with sugar and milk or creamer. I’m not sure why but I’m really not liking the flavor.,3
1946,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/21/2021,Loved it! Shared it with my co-workers immediately and they loved it too. Very happy and going to order more today.,5
1947,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/21/2021,"I ordered these for ease of coffee while camping. However, I have used almost a whole bottle ""testing"" it! I've had it hot and cold. I'm tempted to make this my new coffee regime...SO good and smooth!!",5
1948,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/21/2021,"I love this stuff. It's convenient and delicious. The flavor is very smooth with almost none of the bitterness you see in traditionally brewed coffees. I prefer my Jot iced, but it's equally as good when mixed with hot water.",5
1949,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/21/2021,very good,5
1950,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/21/2021,So easy to make and very smooth.,5
1951,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/20/2021,"I’m a lover of packaged/bottled coffee from Target or Jewel because it is so easy and convenient to make in the mornings when I’m rushed. Jot just made my morning coffee routine even EASIER! Instead of storing jugs or gallons of iced coffee in my refrigerator, I now only store a tiny Jot bottle. I have a mini refrigerator at work, and will be purchasing an extra bottle for work as well. Super simple and convenient! 🙌&#55356;👍&#55356;☕️",5
1952,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/20/2021,"This stuff is easy to make, and tastes pretty good. Not as good as even some of my pod coffees (similar speed to make), but decent for how fast it is. It’s a bummer they don’t have decaf, and kind of expensive per cup…",4
1953,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/20/2021,"I love the dark roast. With some milk, tasted just like hardcord vietnamesr coffee",5
1954,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/20/2021,I liked it quite a lot,5
1955,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/20/2021,"It’s my first time trying Jot, and I’m already in love with the taste. Perfect cup of coffee everyday. Love drinking it with almond milk.",5
1956,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/20/2021,It tastes great,4
1957,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/20/2021,"This coffee is the best! Smooth taste, easy to make, and economical (cup for cup). Highly recommended.",5
1958,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/20/2021,"super easy and quick to use, awesome flavor and taste!",5
1959,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/20/2021,"To be honest, I decided to try this coffee because it came with a free cup that I really wanted. I was anticipating it just to taste like fillers since there is only one tablespoon added per 6 ounces. I was pleasantly surprised that it was actually really good tasting coffee! I am very picky with my coffee and Jot tasted amazing!",5
1960,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/20/2021,Jot coffee is Delicious I'm loving the simplicity of the concentrate formula and all the different ways I get to enjoy an amazing cup of coffee.,5
1961,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/20/2021,"I'm always running late, so I usually end up drinking a stale, disgusting cup of office coffee every morning. Jot has been a game changer. The taste is so rich and flavorful and smooth. It's ridiculously easy to fill a cup with ice, a tablespoon of Jot, and some water and be out the door with no time lost. I'm enjoying my morning coffee again. It is so convenient and I was just shocked at the taste quality! Can't wait to make affogatos this weekend!",5
1962,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/20/2021,works great in its intended or as a topper on ice cream!! i love this & will use religiously,5
1963,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/20/2021,"I’m always open to try new types or coffee, unfortunately they don’t always taste the best. Not over was excellent! Coffee is smooth and as an ice coffee lover it was perfect.",5
1964,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/20/2021,"Iced coffee during the summer is the best, but working from home and never quite getting it right with making coffee the night before and refrigerating it, jot has become my new morning staple!!",5
1965,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/20/2021,"I ordered Jot because a family member very enthusiastically endorsed the coffee to me, saying that he prefers it to Nespresso or even freshly ground French Press coffee. High praise indeed! I immediately went online and ordered both the regular and extra strong. 
I’ve had a few cups since, and am unsure how I feel. While I don’t dislike it, I don’t think my Nespresso machine or French press is in any danger of going out into the dustbin any time soon. 
Maybe I need to play around more with the ratio of coffee to water. The way it tastes to me when made according to directions, is that I need to add sugar or sweetener to it, something that I don’t do at all (which is how my family member drinks it). 
The best endorsement that I can make right now is that it tastes ok, and it sure is easy and convenient to make a cup of iced coffee. 
We’ll see if I change my mind.",3
1966,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/20/2021,"To say I was skeptical would be an understatement, but one sip confirmed all promises fulfilled. I drink mine cold, but my hot coffee drinking son was equally impressed with the taste. You have a great product.",5
1967,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/20/2021,This was my first time trying Jot. I wasn’t sure what to expect but it is sooooo good! It’s like having a gourmet coffee shop in my house. I’ve started every day with a cup of this as an iced latte. I will definitely be reordering. Love it!,5
1968,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/20/2021,Really enjoyed it,5
1969,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/20/2021,I wasn’t sure if the coffee would be as good due to the small serving size but I was wrong! Very good especially iced!!!,5
1970,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/20/2021,The first time I had it my cousin was making for family who wanted. As soon as I had my sip I was HOOKED. And I’m just a occasional coffee drinker. As soon as I got home from the beach that evening I made my first order off Amazon since that’s where she said she buys it. When my 2nd bottle was running low I found your website and made sure I subscribed and got 4 bottles. My mom and I have ours with a caramel protein shake iced and I add a little whip cream and caramel sauce to the top. We have a cup every other day. Sometimes I have 2 a day. Again we are not coffee drinkers but we are now and only JOT coffee.,5
1971,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/20/2021,"I have to say I did not expect to like this coffee. I don’t like cold brewed coffee and definitely have not found an iced coffee that’s sold in bottles that had any decent coffee flavor. My favorite thing is 3 shots of espresso over ice with a plant based milk. Jot is everything that I’ve been searching for flavor wise, it’s extremely smooth and has amazing coffee flavor, and you don’t have to use a lot, I use two tablespoons in a giant glass with ice water and it’s perfect. I can’t believe how good it is. I need more!",5
1972,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/20/2021,"I’m pretty picky with my coffee, and this one does not disappoint!! I’ve only tried it cold (iced) so far, but man is it good! It tastes fresh and smooth. I’ll definitely be ordering again!",5
1973,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/20/2021,"Love the fact I don’t have to brew anything…I can make it hot, cold or lukewarm if I want and enjoy a flavorful cup anytime! I am already telling friends and family about JOT!",5
1974,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/20/2021,"Exceptional Coffee, I highly recommend",5
1975,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/20/2021,"As someone who both doesn't get waking up early but also is a teacher, the ease of this is really nice. However, I wish my subscription starter had come with the tablespoon. I was under the impression that it did as it is marketed as only needing a tablespoon for one cup. With that said, I still need to buy one myself and am not sure if I'm using the right amount and therefore don't yet know how effective Jot is.",4
1976,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/20/2021,"I'm usually skeptical about buying coffee online, but going to get coffee every morning was was too expensive. This stuff is so much better than I thought it would be! I absolutely love it, and you can customize it as you want. I will be subscribing to it once I know how often I'll need it!",5
1977,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/20/2021,Amazing ,5
1978,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/20/2021,The coffee is amazing! I love it! I could drink it all day! Wish I had tried it sooner!,5
1979,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/20/2021,"Ive only had the lighter brew but I think I will like the dark better as I find that I need more of the lighter to suit my taste. that being said, it is a really good alternative to brewing an entire pot of coffee and I especially like it for iced coffee",4
1980,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/20/2021,"This coffee is so delicious and makes mornings easy. The tumbler is an awesome design. As someone who loves iced coffee, the guard is an awesome addition.",5
1981,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/20/2021,Had my first cup this past weekend and it was delicious. Had a rich bold taste and had a smooth taste with no bitterness at all. I had it over ice. I will trythe bolder one next. Great job on this product!,5
1982,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/20/2021,"After blowing through many disappointing grocery store cold brew concentrates, trying to make my own (and failing), and squandering my life's savings on coffee shop cold brews, Jot has come to the rescue. Not sure why it took me so long, but the important thing is that it's in my life now. This cold brew is delicious, rivaling even the best coffee shop versions. The packaging is adorable and takes up way less space in my fridge than other options. And one or two cups gives me the perfect jump start — I have to restrain myself from continuously drinking this all day. Needless to say, I'm a fan!",5
1983,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/20/2021,"From the shipping configuration, to the glass bottles, to the ease of use and multitude of uses, and the taste, this coffee has made me an instant-fan! 

Prepping coffee in the mornings is now quick and easy, while still being tasty and reliable.",5
1984,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/20/2021,"Absolutely the perfect coffee for a quick cup, especially iced. As a parent with kids, having only exactly six seconds to myself each morning, having a cup of coffee in nanoseconds is absolutely glorious! The flavor of Jot is perfect, and leaves nothing to be desired!",5
1985,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/20/2021,I got this for my husband who's job is at 4am. We were a bit skeptical since were huge coffee snobs even going as far as to make sure our beans were roasted within the week otherwise we wont buy. Its actually super good!! We both drink our coffee black and it has a nice mellow flavor profile with barely any acidity. I will say i tried with milk as a latte and we both didn't really enjoy it that way. But since our main morning drink is black coffee I will be buying some more. The cup it came with is phenomenal too.,5
1986,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/20/2021,"We love to be able to make a fresh cold brew first thing with ease in the morning! If you have the glass cup, 8 oz of water makes the rabbit look like it's swimming, so we don't even need to measure the water.",5
1987,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/20/2021,My husband and I absolutely love Jot! It takes the morning irritation out of making a pot of coffee away and is so convenient for people living a busy lifestyle. Highly recommend!,5
1988,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/20/2021,"Love the coffee. Seriously the most amazing iced coffee ever. Smooth and highly drinkable. Fast delivery, cute packaging. I ordered a second two bottle set as a gift.",5
1989,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/20/2021,"I was a little hesitant in buying this but I’m glad I did. Both varieties taste great and are very easy to use. Smooth and work any way you take your coffee, will definitely be buying again.",5
1990,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/20/2021,At first I wasn’t sure if id like this “instantly” coffee. I’m an espresso girl. When I drank this coffee wow it woke me up. Recommend to anyone who is in a hurry and needs coffee to start their day. I find the coffee slightly expensive but if money isn’t a concern I would highly recommend.,5
1991,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/20/2021,"I love coffee. Iced, hot, warm, you name it and I love it. This product makes some of the best iced coffee I’ve had yet from home. I prefer the milk and ice option with Jot. Throw in some chocolate syrup and a little bit of sugar and you basically have a better than 
Dunkin or Starbucks iced coffee right at home. 10/10 would highly recommend.",5
1992,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original (Extra Bottle),09/20/2021,"The best coffee, yet!",5
1993,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/20/2021,Delicious ,5
1994,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/20/2021,It was a great cup of coffee! Will continue to get Jot!,5
1995,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/20/2021,"Tastes good, and very easy to set up a cup. Takes a fair amount more work and time to make a hot drink, but for an iced coffee it's a winner.",4
1996,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/20/2021,The smoothest cup of coffee I’ve ever tasted! I’m addicted! Doubt I’ll ever brew a cup of coffee again!!,5
1997,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/20/2021,I love that my jot bottles came with a recipe card that’s perfect for the fall season! I do enjoy being able to make lattes with such ease and not having to get out of my house. I still need to work on the proportions but it’s a nice flavor.,5
1998,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/20/2021,This is the simplest and easiest coffee,5
1999,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/20/2021,My package came in the mail so well packaged with minimal materials and little to no plastic. I was so excited to try out my new coffee that I was hard pressed to select how I wanted to have my first experience. The package came with a pamphlet detailing some of the best ways to enjoy JOt ultra coffee. Super pumped to try some new recipes,5
2000,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/19/2021,"I’m not a coffee expert, but I am lazy and this was quick and taste good",5
2001,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/19/2021,"I love the convenience of this coffee and it tastes good (not necessarily amazing, but good) but it is a little expensive for the amount you get in the bottle. It’s cheaper than buying a coffee everyday, though.",4
2002,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/19/2021,"The whole experience is well thought out. Great promotion. Fun brand. Exciting proposition and point of difference. From seeing an ad to taking a sip is great. And the best part is – the coffee doesn’t disappoint. It’s what I worried about despite the excellent reviews. I’ve tried a lot of products claiming delicious coffee. And Unless I’ve bought from a trusted coffee shop or made it myself, I’ve never found a product that does a great job. But Jot knows what their doing at a price that is justifiable. I hope more regions of beans get the hot treatment – like an Ethiopian coffee would be good to try. Thanks.",5
2003,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/19/2021,Looking forward to a big jolt from JOT but got an okey dokey jolt. Really like the ease of mixing and experimenting. Look forward to the really dark brew being a biggee,4
2004,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/19/2021,I am a firm lover of iced/cold coffee and this has been the best addition to my busy lifestyle! While I love coffee companies I hate all the waste of plastic and it’s awesome to be able to make my own at home that equally tastes amazing all while using my resizable cups! If your thinking about trying…DO IT! You won’t be disappointed!!,5
2005,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/19/2021,I am halfway into my first bottled of Jot and I'm loving it!!,5
2006,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/19/2021,"I like my coffee to be simple, which is straight black. Sometimes, hot black coffee is not what I want during my afternoon. So jot coffee makes it simple for me to have quality iced coffee for an afternoon pick me up. It taste smooth yet it is strong enough to wake you up and allow you to power through your day.",5
2007,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/19/2021,"Honestly, I was super skeptical because I’ve never tried cold brew before. It was DELISH! I will continue to order these, they are so smooth!! My husband (who is super picky about coffee) also likes them, so they are a win!",5
2008,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/19/2021,Good,5

2010,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/19/2021,This is the best way to start my day! The coffee is delicious and always look forward to the next cup!,5
2011,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/19/2021,"I have to admit I was skeptical and it took a few tries to figure out just how I wanted my morning Jot to taste, but once I got that figured out - it was pure magic! I find myself thinking about having a cup in the afternoon and sometimes even in the evening - it’s so good.",4
2012,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/19/2021,Enjoying both hot and cold. My hubby is also a fan and he’s pretty picky. Also noticed I have 2 coworkers that are enjoying as well. I’ve been making a cup in the morning and packing another for my mid day treat 😊,5
2013,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/19/2021,I can’t figure out which way I like the coffee more (hot or cold). I’ve tried other concentrates that are not as versatile as Jot.,5
2014,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/19/2021,I didn’t know what to expect when buying this. I was initially drawn to the Fellow tumbler and thought I’d give this coffee a try. Oh. My. GOSH. This is the best idea ever. It has made my mornings so easy with just a tablespoon of this concentrate. I’m so glad I bought Jot and I’m definitely going to subscribe to this!,5
2015,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/19/2021,"I love the manageability of this coffee product!!! It is so easy to make, no time spent on brewing, and the taste is delactable! A tablespoon, some ice, a bit of creamer and I am off. Takes no time at all to get my iced coffee fix. I love it. I ordered my second batch a week after getting my first...don't wanna run out!!!",5
2016,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/19/2021,"I tried it as soon as it arrived , and love it. So easy to make and customise to your taste!! I took one bottle to keep in my office , so that’s a little treat during the day ! I highly recommend trying this.",4

2019,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/19/2021,Jot is great. Especially for folks on the go. Great service. Good coffee,5
2020,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/19/2021,I think this slogan has already been used in reference to coffee but here it is again. GOOD TO THE LAST DROP!!,4
2021,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/19/2021,"I’m an avid coffee drinker, and usually use a French press daily. However, some mornings when I’m running behind I want something quick or on the afternoon for a mid-day caffeine pick-me-up without having fo go to a coffee shop or spend time waiting for the coffee to brew, and Jot is now my go-to most days of the week! I love that it is so easy to make a warm cup of coffee or a quick cold brew. I LOVE the flavor with some oat milk, it has such a smooth, nutty flavor and had the same richness that I love from making coffee in the French press. The packaging and attention to detail is also amazing. I highly recommend Jot!",5
2022,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/19/2021,Makes coffee in the morning so quick. And it's honestly the best concentrate I've had.,5
2023,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/19/2021,I have a fancy coffee machine and find Jot not only better but so much more convenient. It is wonderful both hot and cold.,5
2024,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/19/2021,I really enjoyed my first cup of Jot coffee!! with a busy lifestyle it is so easy to make a quick cup that is actually delicious! I mix mine with little oat milk and cinnamon and honey and put it in a ninja blender to froth it up- then put it on ice or heat it up on the stove!,5
2025,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/19/2021,The best ever!!!,5
2026,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/19/2021,"I am absolutely loving my Jot Ultra. As someone who needs coffee immediately after waking up there is nothing easier than preparing my morning iced coffee. The Jot Dark is my favorite just a tablespoon and half of Jot, a handful of ice and water and I have an amazing cup of coffee.
 Somedays after work I need that little pick me up, those days a cup of unsweetened creamy cashew milk, a splash of sugar free vanilla and of course a tablespoon (love my stainless steel Jot spoon) of Jot Dark and I have a fantastic iced latte, minus the crazy coffee shop prices. Thank you Jot!!",5
2027,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/19/2021,"I was skeptical but have been more than persuaded. I love Jot hot, cold, with milk, with water... it's simplified my morning routine and allowed me to get really good coffee into my system faster than ever. Both original and dark are supremely tasty - not bitter, bland, burned or artificial tasting at all. Friends are getting tired of hearing me rave about it!",5
2028,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/19/2021,"I will admit that I was skeptical about ordering through a Facebook add. To my surprise though the product arrived within 7 days. Now for the taste test, I placed the Jot in the refrigerator to chill, later made a cup as directed with 8oz of cold water and 1 tablespoon of concentrate. Just a splash of creamer and some ice. I give it a 10 for sure, it has a great coffee flavor, not overpowering or odd after taste. Will be ordering again.",5
2029,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/19/2021,This coffee is no joke!! If you have caffeine sensitivity start out with half the suggested amount!! Super strong but damn is it good!! Using half the amount just means it will last longer! Such great rich flavor without having to take time out of my rushed morning!! Will definitely be buying more for family @ Xmas!!,4
2030,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/19/2021,"Primarily got it as a quick cold brew that was easier for my daughter to control the strength. She can make it before heading out the door for school.

I like it too. We often use a half tablespoon as we need ours on the weak side. Much easier than trying to get the perfect amount of grounds.

Tastes delicious.",5
2031,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/19/2021,"Fits the bill for convenience, eco-conscious, good flavor, and reasonable price. Will be reordering.",5
2032,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/19/2021,Tastes amazing!!! Easy to make! Adorable bottle! Takes up little room in the fridge! I love Jot. You don’t regret trying it out!,5

2034,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/19/2021,"Jot coffee tastes great. I bought the original and dark combo. I liked them both, but my preference is the dark. My coffee is smooth and never bitter. I enjoyed it so much that I began a monthly subscription.",5
2035,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/19/2021,so smooth! and so easy to prepare!,5
2036,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/19/2021,This product is awesome and it’s an extra perk it doesn’t take up room in the refrigerator,5
2037,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/19/2021,So excited to find such a great tasting coffee that makes it SO easy to make iced coffee and delicious drinks at home!!,5
2038,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/19/2021,"I drink coffee out of necessity. Some people joke that I have a splash of coffee with my milk every morning. My SO has been drinking coffee since he was a teen, is super particular about his coffee, and drinks it black. We both were able to find a compromise with Jot. It's tasty, convenient, and so far it's been a hit in our household.",5
2039,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/19/2021,Tasty!,5
2040,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/19/2021,"First coffee bought online, I took a risk. I got the package delivered quickly and it was in an awesome looking packaging. Coffee tastes great, I have already got 2 of my colleagues at work hooked and already purchased a couple of bottles. I do recommend it!!!",5
2041,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/19/2021,Added jot to milk for an at home iced late and finished it before the ice could start melting,5
2042,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/19/2021,"Very smooth taste. Easy to make any way you want it, making it virtually impossible to have a bad cup.",5
2043,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/19/2021,"I love iced coffee. It’s a pain to brew or make hot coffee and then ice it down. I don’t even own a coffee maker. I spend way too much of my disposable income on iced Americano‘s. No milk, no flavor, black coffee ice and water.

Jot is delicious tasting. Efficient as heck. Low stress. 
I especially like that I don’t have to get hot to then get it cold. And if it’s too strong you just add a little bit of water if it’s too weak you just add a little bit of shot. Honestly… a serious upgrade. 

I buy Americano’s from the coffee shop and I don’t mind because they’re pretty inexpensive. My second coffee crush is on Starbucks double shot in the can. The regular coffee and cream combo. In a 6.5 ounce can. I ordered them by the 12 pack. Which I have not been able to find in two months. It’s a serious expensive habit. But if you’ve ever had one of those they’re really freaking good. I’m hoping to make a homemade version.",5
2044,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/19/2021,I love this coffee! It's so easy and convenient to make my iced coffee on the way out the door for work. I'm hooked!,5
2045,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/18/2021,I tried Jot. I would have never quit coffee if I was drinking this stuff. I subscribed soon after my first cup. It’s so good.,5
2046,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/18/2021,Great coffee and it’s so easy!,5
2047,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/18/2021,"Very clean taste, and super convenient for on the go. One of the most efficient cups of coffee you'll ever have.",5

2049,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/18/2021,"I was a little apprehensive purchasing coffee from an Instagram add but I was wonderfully surprised by how fast, easy and tasty this coffee arrived! Thank you can serve it any way and it tastes smooth! I prefer the original but my husband likes the dark so the mixed pack works well for us! Would definitely recommend!!",5

2052,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/18/2021,"We're trying to cut down on how much coffee we drink out, and this has been a big help. We mostly use it for iced coffee (ok, milk + jot + sometimes some vanilla) and that's about it.
Well worth it! The regular is much better than the dark imo.",4
2053,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/18/2021,I bought original and dark roast but only tried the original first. Very convenient and to be honest quite flavorful.,5
2054,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/18/2021,Been a daily coffee drinker for a couple years now. Often have to drink quite a bit to actually feel the caffeine. Not with this. A single Tablespoon packs a stronger caffeine punch than a large cup any coffee I've tried so far. Even the 'extreme' ones that feel the need to warn you about how strong they are. Not to mention it's delicious!,5
2055,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/18/2021,I love using it to make caramel iced coffee!,5

2060,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/18/2021,"This coffee concentrate is spectacular. I am NOT a morning person, and I am not a fan of hot coffee. But I love, love, love me some cold brew. I used to make it myself but it was such a pain dealing with the grinds and clean-up afterwards. I saw this product advertised (and had a little smile as Jot was the name of an old family dog) and decided to give it a shot. So worth it. It’s quick to whip up in the morning before work (I do a spoonful of raw sugar, water, and oat milk). Delicious flavor. It’s got that bite and I can adjust the sweetness to however I’m feeling that day. Wound up losing an entire bottle due to Hurricane Ida here in southeast Louisiana - I was sent a replacement bottle after reaching out (I figured it couldn’t hurt to ask; they’re a business first and foremost - the worst they could say is no). Impeccable customer service, fabulous product, I cannot say more. I’ve also got the mini white thermos and the glasses and I love those as well. I will be signing up for the subscription once I’m done with what I have here. If you’re on the fence, go for it. I love this stuff.",5
2061,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/18/2021,"I’m typically not a big fan of cold brew so I was hesitant to try Jot, but this DELICIOUS, SMOOTH, STRONG, ROBUST and BALANCED coffee concentrate BLEW ME AWAY. I’m a changed woman and dedicated to Jot! Highly highly recommend!",5
2062,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/18/2021,Very strong stuff but even smoother. I combine with 8 oz of water and a splash of sugar free caramel. Nothing can stop me after downing one of those.,5
2063,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/18/2021,"My main goal was to have a quick fix for a decent iced-coffee/cold brew. Jot delivered with a simple solution that's easy to mix, is already cold and has great taste.",5
2064,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/18/2021,This is so good and easy for the morning!!,5
2065,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/18/2021,Great coffee. Smooth. Not bitter or acidic. I ordered the dark because i like it strong.,5
2066,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/18/2021,I love the ability to make so many different variations and can switch it up each day. It’s so quick and easy to make at any time in the day. Highly recommend!,5
2067,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/18/2021,"I read many reviews before deciding to give this a try and I'm glad I did! It's pretty delicious (I made an iced oatmilk latte using the original ultra coffee)! Can't wait to try making other drinks with this! Had to dock a star because the price point is quite high for such a small bottle and despite its deliciousness, I can't justify drinking it daily. Would probably save it as an occasional midweek/weekend treat only. Would love to see slightly bigger bottle options offered for less in the future! Thanks Jot!",4
2068,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/18/2021,I have always been a Starbucks girl until I got turned onto your coffee. I was recommended to give your coffee a try and I fell in love from the first set! Five star quality coffee that I can make it home that surpasses anything Starbucks can do :),5
2069,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/18/2021,This coffee is so good and SO easy to make. I'll probably never go to a coffee shop again,5
2070,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/18/2021,"A little goes a long way! Jot is a super easy way for me to make great iced coffee at home - the kind that's actually caffeinated and doesn't taste watered down. The bottles themselves are small, easy to handle, and easy to stow away. This is my first purchase after a friend's recommendation, and I'm already set on subscribing to make sure I have a steady supply from here on out!",5
2071,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/18/2021,"…and ordered my first batch of Jot. So glad I did. I had been looking at it for a while and with the declining quality of coffee options around me, and the need for on the go caffeine, I thought now was the time. I have no regrets! It was easy and delicious and there are so many recipes I want to try! I know it’s crazy to say, but I’d love a decaf option for that afternoon pick me up that’s wont keep me up.",5
2072,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/18/2021,The coffee is delicious and so much cheaper than buying iced coffee out. Love it!,5
2073,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/18/2021,"I travel for work, and you never know if you’re going to get a good cup of coffee in your hotel room. Jot was an awesome fix to this problem. And let me tell you! I haven’t had the mid-day slump since I started drinking Jot!",5

2077,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/18/2021,Makes great coffee!! Iced or hot so yummy. Love it for when I need to run out the door and do not have time to brew coffee. Never bitter always delicious!,5
2078,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/18/2021,"I don’t know much about coffee, but I know my body keeps wanting more of this coffee and I’m less interested in other coffees. Wish there was a decaf so I could drink it all day.",5
2079,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/18/2021,The coffee is so smooth and it is so easy to make iced or hot coffee. I can’t see going back to brewing my coffee. I use a tablespoon of both the original and dark for My perfect blend.,5
2080,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/18/2021,I worked at Starbucks for 6 years. And even after left I spent crazy amounts of money ordering coffee everyday. Then I bought Jot. I will never go back to Starbucks again. Jot gives me everything I need right from home! It’s so delicious and the cup is amazing!,5
2081,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/18/2021,I love it. I need to buy more lol. I’m caffeinated as I’m typing this.

2082,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/18/2021,I was very pleased with the flavor of both Jot coffees. I will for sure order again. Thanks for making a great product.,5
2083,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/18/2021,When I first ordered Jot I planned on using it on those mornings when I was too rushed to make a pot of coffee. I was really impressed with the rich flasks how much I liked it. Then I tried it in oat milk and now my coffee pot is retired.,5
2084,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/18/2021,I gave Jot a try because i was looking for something quick and easy to start my morning. I wake up around 3-4 am and iced coffee is my go to and this has been by far the best product I have tried yet.,5
2085,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/18/2021,We all get roped into buying things we see online and it’s really a 50/50 that’s it’s going to be a total waste of money but I’m so glad I went for this one. Best at home iced coffee/latte in the morning! I’m so glad I tried it. Only mistake I made was offering my husband a taste and now I have to share!,5

2088,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/18/2021,Personally very sensitive to caffeine and I was running around like a headless chicken after drinking jot! You have been warned! Drink at your own risk if you want to promote productivity. Disclosing amount of caffeine in the box will be helpful,4
2089,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/18/2021,"Ohh my God, school good. I had my first cup yesterday and I'm still buzzing. The to go cup that came with my order keeps the ice unmelted for 8 freaking hours!! Will definitely use this everyday.",5
2090,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/18/2021,"Taste is good. I'm a nursing student with some of my classes online, and it saves me the trip to buying coffee outside and saves me time with just a tablespoon instead of having to deal with cleaning a coffee pot and other tools. Love how simple it is, and tasty too :)",5
2091,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/17/2021,"Good flavor, convient for quick on the go coffee when you are on the run in the mornings",5

2108,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/17/2021,I absolutely love it! I didnt know what to expect when I got the package. I was blown away from the smooth bold flavor. I make a mug in my new Fellow traveler everyday before work. Definitely will be ordering again.,5
2109,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/17/2021,"Jot is a great idea — I love its convenience and promise of consistency — and its packaging and inserts are very classy. I would like to embrace Jot. Unfortunately, after several experimental cups my wife and I have concluded that we prefer to drink our conventionally brewed Starbucks ground coffee. Sorry to say so.",3
2110,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/17/2021,Best cold brew I’ve found,5
2111,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/17/2021,"Not gonna lie, I wasn't expecting Jot to be as good as it is. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I like the coffee and the free Fellow travel mug was much appreciated--it's now my new favorite!",5
2112,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/17/2021,This stuff tastes great with milk added. Only gripe is that I use 2tbsp of Jot per serving so it gets used up twice as quick!,4

2120,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/16/2021,"This coffee is so freaking good. I’m usually an avid Starbucks customer but Jot has completely replaced my daily iced latte.

2121,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/16/2021,As a flight attendant I live on coffee changing time zones but I refuse to drink hotel room and plane coffee because who knows where those machines have been and plane water is gross. Buying coffee at cafes gets to be pretty expensive so the coffee concentrate is so easy to throw in my lunch box and is so flavorful I don’t need any cream or sugar.,5
2122,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/15/2021,I enjoy the convenience and smooth taste.,5

2126,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/15/2021,"I first got this as an alternative to cold brew. At this point I use it in both cold and hot beverages: lattes, pour over and iced coffee. Really good and smooth coffee, especially handy if you are in a monrning rush",5
2127,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/15/2021,I really wanted to like it as hot coffee but it tasted a little more bitter than I’m used to. If you like a bitter than this is for you. I personally like a toasty roasty coffee flavor.,3
2128,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/15/2021,I was definitely surprised at the level of flavor this one tablespoon had. I made as an iced coffee. Added some stevia heavy whipping cream and almond milk and it was amazing. Definitely recommend. I wish I had ordered when they had the glasses. But I dis get the travel cup.,5

I had seen these coffee concentrates online and I honestly tried another brand first.

2145,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/14/2021,"I didn't think there was any way this coffee could be so amazing, but it is! As soon as I tied it I told my girlfriend to get rid of the nespresso because we were going to be a Jot family from now on.",5
2146,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/14/2021,"I have a small place so have single serve coffee press that is obnoxious to clean and the coffee just tastes like basic home coffee. I love the ease and taste of Jot, can dress it up how I want (I use almond milk and a little chai tea mix!). Tastes like a proper coffee shop order and can refuel with a quick tbsp. The mug though, WOW. It’s perfect sized not those huge cups, fits in the cup holder, keeps it’s temp hot or cold, sleek and love that it is unbranded. It seals tight but my favorite thing is the splash guard! I carry it on walks and can drink it in the car without inevitably staining my shirt or pants. Was not expecting to love this brand so much after trying so many different coffee options.",5
2147,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/14/2021,I love Jot i usually need cream and sugar I don’t need anything! Black. So happy because I’m trying tocutout sugar,5
2148,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/14/2021,I was unsure about how this would taste but I am thrilled with the result. Great deal and saves me time and money not stopping to get coffee every morning.,5
2149,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/14/2021,"Honestly very impressed. My partner who claims to be a coffee snob loves the original, it’s so quick and convenient, especially in the morning compared to our usual pour over! It’s also STRONG, a few sips and i feel it immediately. Worth it, especially considering i got the special with the fellow mug! (We already have multiple fellow products so this was a no brainer).",5
2150,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/14/2021,"Jot made my cold brew dreams come true. The smooth richness mixed with frothed coconut milk and collagen peptides, this cup of goodness gets my day started right.",5
2151,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/14/2021,I have been keto for almost 6 years so I drink alot of coffee and I can say jot has brought their game! The dark was a little strong for me so I added water and flavoring. But the original is perfect just some water and half and half and have the best cup of coffee!,5
2152,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/14/2021,"I was skeptical at first but it truly is very delicious, very convenient and quick to make a large glass of iced coffee which I love in the summer. I may order more after all it’s how I start my day!!!!",3
2153,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/14/2021,I tried this plain with just water and ice and I tried it with a splash of creamer. It had a distinct sour taste that I didn’t enjoy. I had my husband mix his own cup and he tasted the sourness as well. I’m a little disappointed as I was really excited to try it.,3
2154,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/14/2021,"This had changed my coffee routine! I love Jot especially the original, its super smooth and pair wonderfully with my oat milk! Highly recommend every coffee love try this!",5
2155,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/14/2021,"Excelent taste and so smooth. Makes my cafe con leche so delicious. It is a genius formula. My favorite is the regular, it reminds me of the coffee I have when I go to Colombia…I’m sold. No more k-cup😂.",5
2156,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/14/2021,im awake 10/10 coffee <3,5

2158,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/14/2021,I am absolutely obsessed with this coffee! One tablespoon every morning with some vanilla oat milk over ice and I am good to go for the day!,5
2159,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/14/2021,Was skeptical at first but pleased with this coffee!,5
2160,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/14/2021,The coffee tastes absolutely phenomenal. Plus the bottle is so cute! Such a fun and tasty creation.,5
2161,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/14/2021,I’m in the navy and I work nights Jot is the perfect on the go coffee that fits my lifestyle!,5
2162,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/14/2021,"I enjoy the process of making pour over coffee in the morning and find it to be a great ritual. I never really cared for an instant coffee or cold brew that needs to be diluted and still gives you anxiety. Lo and behold, jot came in with their own take instant coffee and it delivers on taste and energy. Love the plastic free packaging and the overall look. The main appeal is if you don’t have the mental capacity in the morning to work a basic coffee maker, jot has got you. The phrase “Just add water” has never been more appropriate.",5
2163,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/14/2021,Easy to prepare and customizable to my liking. So many ways to enjoy.,5
2164,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/14/2021,"Jot is great because it is so easy to store and prepare, yet it still tastes good. Usually, you sacrifice flavor for convenience. Not here!",5
2165,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/14/2021,I love how easy and tasty this coffee is. The dark roast is my favorite. :),5
2166,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/14/2021,I love Jot! It has helped with my busy morning routines by taking that one extra step out of the way. It's incredibly versatile to meet what ever coffee style I feel like having each day or by being that extra cup without brewing a whole pot of drip. Very grateful to have found jot and can't wait to see their limited edition batches in the future.,5
2167,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/13/2021,"Having sampled both the original and the dark, I can honestly say that it's pretty good for the convenience of ""ready made"" coffee. It's not going to replace your traditional pour over or espresso, just like K-cups and nespressos won't ever replace a good coffee shop, it is a nice quick substitute - better than instant coffee but has some of the same aftertaste to it. I do prefer the dark, which has a richer note to the taste while the original has that bright slightly acidic flavor to coffee. As a side note: I like my coffee strong and use more than the 1 tablespoon recommended. I definitely give 3 star for taste, add another for the convenience and packaging, which is very pretty.",4
2168,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/13/2021,It was soooo good!!! I was surprised at the taste and mouth feel of it. It was smooth and had a good acidity too it!,5
2169,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/13/2021,Received my order promptly. Love the white travel thermos. Perfect. Coffee liquid easy to measure and deal with. Fast and easy and out the door! Love it!,5
2170,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/13/2021,"Got Jot based on reviews, and recent obsession with cold brew. 

Love the taste, convenience, exceptionally rich flavor. 
I’ve found my cold brew of choice !",5
2171,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/13/2021,"I'll be honest, I was expecting more from this, but the coffee just felt so watered down. My husband and I felt like we were drinking coffee-flavored water and for the price, I was hoping to have a proper cup of coffee.",3
2172,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/13/2021,We loved it and will be ordering more!,5
2173,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/13/2021,"The new Dark coffee smelled and tasted amazing. I let a friend of mine (who never drinks coffee) try it and he became an instant fan. Also, the free Fellow mug that came with my purchase adds additional dimensions of flavor and efficiency.",5
2174,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/13/2021,"Honestly I decided I needed the convenience of JOT but it just flat out tastes better than any coffee I can make myself. I've tried the espresso machine (messy), the french press (couldn't get the grind right) and I always ended up going back to my ""passable"" drip coffee machine. No more. I'm saving so much time and actually enjoying coffee again.",5
2175,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/13/2021,"Really impressed with Jot so far -- everything was packaged beautifully, love the bundle that included the Fellow travel mug, and my first few cups of coffee (one iced and one black hot coffee) have been excellent for a few seconds of work. I'll likely still do my pour-over for the ritual and lovely aroma of brewing coffee, but Jot will be my go-to if I need a quick coffee! Unmatched flavor for an ""instant""-speed coffee.",4
2176,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/13/2021,I love the convenience of it! It’s definitely keeping me from spending $5-6 on a Starbucks coffee everyday,5
2177,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/13/2021,I’ve always loved a cup of coffee (iced or hot) in the morning before/during school or on the weekends while relaxing. Jot is the best way for me to do this without stressing out over prepping coffee! I’ve been way more adventurous in my coffee drinking than ever before and I’m saving money because of it.,5
2178,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/13/2021,I was pleasantly surprised by how smooth and tasteful this coffee is. It is amazing quality and I will continue to purchase this! Amazing product!,5
2179,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/13/2021,Disappointed that there was no spoon included!!!,3
2180,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/13/2021,Love JOT with ice and oatmilk!,5

2186,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/13/2021,Was skeptical at first. Made a glass for the wife and she was blown away. She's very picky when it comes to her coffee. Will be a regular customer. thank you.,5
2187,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/13/2021,The Jot coffee is so deliciously smooth and it was easy to make to my taste. I just added water and almond milk and it rivals anything I have bought at those brand name coffee places. So good and packs a punch! Love it!!!,5
2188,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/13/2021,"I will admit I was skeptical when I placed my order, but I read the reviews and wanted to give this product a chance. Needless to say, there was no disappointment here! My measure of a good coffee is if it can have a bold flavor without being too strong or acidic. I have made both iced coffee and a hot latte with Jot and loved them both. This is so convenient and I will be placing orders closer to the holidays for my Christmas gift baskets for friends and family.",5
2189,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/13/2021,I have tried the original and dark versions of Jot and they are both fantastic! I’ve made hot drinks as well as iced and every attempt has been so delicious. It’s foolproof! Thanks for a great product!,5
2190,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/13/2021,"Very good, smooth and refreshing",5
2191,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/13/2021,I got my package last week and drinking Jot every day since. It’s super easy to make each morning and the taste is great! I had ordered a measuring spoon with my initial order and unfortunately it didn’t make it into the shipment. I contacted Jot and they immediately rectified the situation and sent a shipment out with just the spoon. Mistakes happen and it was nice to work with a company that fixed it so fast and easy!,5
2192,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/13/2021,Surprisingly tasty! Love it Iced!,5
2193,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/13/2021,"It’s our new favorite coffee drink! It tastes just as good as going to a cafe. It’s more economical too. You can customize it to whatever drink you feel like for the day, either cold or hot drink. So glad we tried it! You should too. You won’t regret.",5
2194,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/13/2021,Jot is an easy and delicious start to my day. Mix one tablespoon with hot milk for a latte substitute. Fast and easy. Delicious and smooth without any sweetener. I am hooked.,5
2195,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/13/2021,We loved the convenience of this! It tasted really good!,5
2196,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/13/2021,"I do really love jot original and have high hopes for the dark version, My only complaint is how fast the bottle runs out.",5
2197,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/13/2021,Ice coffee never was easier or more delicious.,5
2198,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/13/2021,"Ordered hoping that we wouldn’t regret it, and Jot did not disappoint. It’s a neat concept and will be great for keeping at work since there’s no longer a communal coffee maker with COVID. The free gift travel mug is awesome. Love it and that really made it feel like we got an amazing deal!",5
2199,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/13/2021,Super easy and excellent flavor. Perfect for mixing in my morning shake!,5
2200,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/13/2021,Tasty and so easy,5
2201,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/13/2021,Great cold brew. Smooth and not bitter. Curious about the bold bottle as there is a mud like sediment at the bottom. Is this because it’s bold and stronger?,5
2202,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/13/2021,I fully expected this to taste like instant coffee. Not even close. I’ve been using the Original which is delicious made with vanilla almond milk over ice or hot. I also enjoyed it in hot water with a splash or two of flavored creamer. It has a very smooth flavor and is not bitter at all. I am looking forward to trying the Dark next. ,5

2204,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/13/2021,It’s yummy but has an interesting after taste. Will order again! The starter kit was the easiest. It is just as convenient as it was stated :),4
2205,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/13/2021,Love this coffee and love the fact that it takes up only a small amount of space in my fridge! This is my new iced coffee go-to!,5
2206,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/13/2021,My wife and I now use Jot as our primary source of coffee. Hot or cold it’s delicious and simple to prepare. We love that the ingredients are organic and the bottles don’t take up much room in our refrigerator. We will definitely be back for more.,5
2207,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/13/2021,"I love coffee. I am a teacher and LIVE on coffee! This coffee has been such a smooth and healthy energy that I know nothing compares anymore… 
I didn’t get a “crash” afterwards and has been a blessing for me to get through these school days lately! 
I love this coffee and found it hard to enjoy my previous coffee loves, I will definitely be a regular at Jot!",5
2208,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/13/2021,"First sip was surprisingly nice. It had a subtle vanilla note. Once coffee was stored in fridge, I found that this taste went away and this coffee turnt pretty bland, though I was caffeinated that’s for sure. For the convenience of it all however I might give this another try.",3
2209,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/13/2021,"Wonderful taste, and easy to use.",5
2210,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/13/2021,"Easy-Check, Quick- Check, Tasty- Check check

2213,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/13/2021,I brought this to my office and it’s actually made a huge difference in my mood in the afternoon. I look forward to it EVERY DAY,5
2214,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/13/2021,"My first sip, I was hooked! I have been drinking JOT now for a few days and making it different each time. I havent had any that I didn't truly enjoy. This is the ultimate coffee in my eyes. It gets no better!",5
2215,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/13/2021,Doesn’t get much easier than this for great cup of coffee,5
2216,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/13/2021,"seen your product on the ""Crunch Bros"" YouTube and wanted to try it and it wasnʻt a mistake! going to order for my family and friends now!",5
2217,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/13/2021,I tried Jot for the first time and I have to say I just love the product! I am a regular iced coffee drinker and have ordered brewed coffee from a few other companies. Jot is great because just one tablespoon makes a robust flavorful cup of iced coffee and produces lass waist & mess than other brands or home cold brewing. After one bottle I am hooked!,5
2218,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/12/2021,It’s ok I’m trying to get the right strength but it has a bitter aftertaste no matter how much I put in which is a little disappointing not sure I’ll order again,3
2219,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/12/2021,"The convenience of instant coffee meets the taste and quality of good coffee. I like how quickly I can have a cup of coffee ready with Jot. Does it hold up well against my favorite local cold brew? No, but it’s not supposed to. It takes 2 seconds to prepare, and costs one fifth the local spot. Recommended if you like your coffee easy.",4
2220,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/12/2021,Jot has made it so quick and easy to make an iced coffee and get the pep I need to start the day! Best purchase I’ve made in a long while!,5
2221,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/12/2021,"I’ve recently become obsessed with cold brew and iced coffee and immediately noticed that it was not financially sustainable for me to hit a drive thru every morning. I tried making my own at home, but it was never the same and more time/effort than I cared to give. I tried the bag in a box (like boxed wine) and it was good, but shipping took forever and it didn’t last long enough to make the painful shipping time worth it. Then I saw an add for Jot and figured why not… By far my favorite thing I’ve tried!! Shipping was super fast, and free! I only use one tablespoon in my morning iced coffee and the flavor is amazing and there is no shortage of caffeine. My husband likes the dark one so the two pack was a great choice for us. I will be a returning customer!",5
2222,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/12/2021,It’s a strong coffee but taste awesome.👍👍👏👏👏❤️🤤,5
2223,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/12/2021,I just received my order of 2 kinds of Jot snd have had 3 mugs of the Original. So convenient and flavorful. I like strong coffee so use more than the recommended 1 tablespoon and it’s perfect. Perhaps the stronger blend will be my choice.,5
2224,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/12/2021,Smooth and tasty,5
2225,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/12/2021,Great flavor and super easy to customize to any taste! Will definitely be ordering more,5
2226,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/12/2021,This makes it so easy to wake up and decide whether I want hot or iced coffee and make it in just seconds. I LOVE this coffee. It is so tasty and smooth without any bitterness.,5
2227,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/12/2021,"The taste of Jot coffee is good, but what takes the cake is the sheer ease of fixing a iced latte or americano. I used to drive to Starbucks everyday to get their cold brew, and now I just make my own in 1 minute flat.",5
2228,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/12/2021,I was unsure how this little excursion into my coffee experience would turn out. So many times I've heard about the latest coffee product/process/blah blah blah. And they were often disappointing. This one was a pleasant surprise and will become a part of my normal 'add a shot of coffee to my mushroom/protein mix' shake. It is a welcome and yummy addition.,5
2229,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/12/2021,"The flavor profile met, and exceeded, my expectations. Smooth w/dark, roasty flavor. I enjoy mostly non-dairy(almond/soy) lattes with Jot Dark. *I made a latte w/chocolate milk too, and it was very good.",5
2230,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/12/2021,Making coffee has never been this convenient. Only takes 1 minute to get a cup of coffee going.,5
2231,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/12/2021,I make a horrible cup of coffee. It’s always burned or too weak. Using Jot has turned my busy (and by busy I mean sitting on my front porch and drinking coffee) mornings when I’m up before my hubby can make coffee into an actually enjoyable cup.,5
2232,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/12/2021,Aside from not getting my spoon. The coffee is amazing!!! I will def purchase again!,5
2233,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/12/2021,It really is incredibly easy and incredibly smooth. I’m still tinkering with my recipes to incorporate Jot into my daily beverages. I’d love to see a tablespoon measure incorporated into the cap for the bottles.,5
2234,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/12/2021,"I was a little skeptical about trying this coffee because I find that most coffee concentrates or instant coffees are very bitter with no real flavor. However, Jot is amazing! The flavor is rich and pairs well with every type of milk and syrup, and it is very smooth, not bitter or acidic. My only complaint is that I have to use more than the recommended amount to get the flavor I want but it’s so good that that barely matters!",5
2235,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/12/2021,I enjoy cold coffee and my husband likes hot coffee. We get the best of both worlds. I really like the ease of making coffee now. No more coffee pot on the bar.,5
2236,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/12/2021,"I got these to try but I was very skeptical, there was no way this stuff could make an ok cup of coffee…we’ll color me surprised, this stuff is amazing and makes great coffee. I’m hooked. I used a little more than the recommended tsp but it’s still so good.",5
2237,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/12/2021,Great for busy parents who love coffee and NEED caffeine! I’ve been drinking it iced with a splash of oat milk and don’t miss my daily lattes!,5

2239,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/12/2021,"I am a huge coffee lover and one of my favorite things to do is hit up local coffee shops. However, I just moved to and area where there aren’t that many coffee shops to frequent. So, I was looking for something that I could make at home that would be a good substitute, add that to being a sucker for Instagram ads, and viola…insert my Jot order. I was a little skeptical at first but after the first cup, I was sold. Totally worth trying.",5
2240,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/12/2021,"As someone who really just enjoys iced coffee, Jot allows me to make my own simple and delicious iced coffee every morning. My only complaint would be that, currently, I can’t buy it in larger batches!",5

2243,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/12/2021,I am so picky about my coffee. Y’all - Jot is a perfect way to get a delicious coffee and still make it “my way”.,5
2244,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/12/2021,"Tried the dark and the original, and am leaning toward the original. Both are good but the original just tastes smoother and a bit sweeter to me. I use Jot for iced coffee and like it a little stronger so I use about 1.25 TBSP and with a splash of sweet cream, it's perfect. I'm hoping there will be value packs to bring the pricing down a bit. Every penny counts!",5
2245,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/12/2021,Delicious and love that I can customize the strength.,5
2246,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/12/2021,I added sparkling water to a tablespoon of Jot and it was fantastic! I love the convenience of the product!,5

I for sure plan to order more once I run low (might be sooner than I think ha-ha)",5
2248,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/12/2021,If you are on the fence..do it! You won’t regret it! Dark is my personal favorite!,5
2249,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/12/2021,Makes mornings so much easier for a quick concentrated iced or hot latte. Also have used it to add more coffee flavor when I’ve made my drip coffee too weak!,5
2250,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/11/2021,"I am grateful for this coffee. I drank coffee black for years, then had to start adding half and half to ease my stomach. Jot coffee has allowed me to use less half and half, I have not had any stomach aches from drinking Jot, and it tastes terrific. An added, important bonus? Jot comes in a glass bottle, not a plastic bottle. 

I hadn’t expected to be so happy about a coffee!",5
2251,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/11/2021,Honestly surprisingly good flavor for a concentrate. It tastes just like regular coffee and super easy. I take it to work as iced coffee in a sealed mug so I can have an afternoon pick-me-up real easily!,5
2252,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/11/2021,I prefer the taste of this over many of the popular coffee shop coffees. And the convenience is icing on the cake!,5
2253,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/11/2021,Very good taste and its so easy to make. I will be buying more.,5
2254,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/11/2021,"Is Jot. The fact that I get to sleep an extra 5-10 minutes because making coffee is so fast, is the best part of waking up! And I have not compromised in taste or flavor of coffee! I am a total Jot convert!!",5
2255,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/11/2021,I’ve used it a few times in my iced coffee with macadamia nut milk and it was delicious! I’m thinking of buying it for friends for Christmas. I’ve also used it in my coffee cream cheese frosting for my banana cake and it was winners!!!,5
2256,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/11/2021,"Definitely the easiest and best way I’ve taken my coffee, Let’s just say normally I would take a monster to work every night, but after trying jot, I haven’t had an energy drink since my order was delivered, the bold Taste is really good I actually don’t use as much cream as I normally would, definitely enjoying it and needing a refill soon",5
2257,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/11/2021,"The coffee is strong and smooth. It’s also so easy to make, perfect for parents who have little time.",5
2258,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/11/2021,"I was a little skeptical at first, but this coffee really tastes great! The flavor is nice and smooth, nutty and not too acidic for me which is what I prefer in coffee. I also work as a nurse and often drink about 3 cups per shift, but I've stuck to just one cup made with the concentrate and it's surprisingly kept me awake. I'm a fan and will definitely be ordering more!",5
2259,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/11/2021,Simply enjoy the dark more :),4
2260,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/11/2021,"I might be drinking a little too much!

I started with one of each and I am going to reorder with two dark. I enjoy the flavor more.

Great alternative!",5
2261,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/11/2021,"This is the best cold coffee I’ve ever had. I’m someone who is ALWAYS on the go, always has somewhere to be, and I don’t always have time for my slow drip coffee. It’s so convenient to keep the bottle in my desk mini fridge and just have a cup at my convenience. It’s so smooth and tasty and I can’t stop drinking it! I’ve recommended it to everyone so far.",5
2262,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/11/2021,Love,5
2263,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/11/2021,Thanks for the discount... I have my whole office staff hooked on JOT!!,5

2265,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/11/2021,I love the flavor and the convenience,5
2266,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/11/2021,i like it. the taste is a nice mellow coffee flavor with very little bitterness. quick and easy to prepare. it also does very well as a iced coffee too.,5
2267,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/11/2021,"Holy cow, I love making the iced latte! It’s still super strong for me, so I add some sugar, but it packs all the caffeine punch I need that two large iced coffee from a chain could never match. Well done 👍",4
2268,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/11/2021,"As a mom of an infant and toddler, I need lots of coffee and I need it FAST! Not only is Jot super easy to make, it’s delicious!!",5
2269,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/11/2021,My daughters and I are obsessed with iced coffee and we have tried all kinds. We have tried all types and brands. I was shocked at how great Jot tastes and my girls and I love it.,5
2270,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/11/2021,Love the taste of this coffee! And I love that it saves me time!,5
2271,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/11/2021,"Great taste, better than expected. Placing my next order, now! ",5
2272,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/11/2021,"Ordered Jot for the convenience and got so much more. Not only is it delicious, it tasted better than the coffee at the local big brand shop. So glad, I ordered not one but two.",5
2273,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/11/2021,"Very fast way to make some coffee, convenient and easy but it is way to acidic for my liking.",3
2274,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/11/2021,This actually tastes to me like properly brewed fresh lightly roasted beans. And saves me so much time in the morning. I’m hooked.,5
2275,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/11/2021,A great cup of coffee is so easy now with Jot. Strong flavor and easy to make. I’m in love.,5
2276,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/11/2021,"I had my first cup of Ultra dark coffee and let me tell you, it was amazing! I like iced coffee that I make at home but I hate brewing hot and then pouring over ice. I used 1.5 tablespoons of the ultra dark with my protein shake and it was so yummy!! I’m hooked on Jot!",5
2277,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/11/2021,"Ice, Jot, milk… boom. I was impressed at how good and simple it is.",5
2278,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/11/2021,"Maybe I expected more, but in the end, it’s just OK. I found that I needed at least twice as much for a true coffee flavor. One tablespoon was not nearly enough. Of course that means you go through the small bottle very quickly. Truthfully, if I made a strong pot of coffee & added ice & creamer, it would be just as good & much cheaper. I don’t think I’d buy it again.",3
2279,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/11/2021,"Let’s be honest, I’m not that much of a snob, I’ll drink sludge in the morning if it has caffeine in it but this stuff is actually incredible.",5
2280,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/11/2021,I love Jot. The Ultra coffee has made iced coffee or iced lattes in the morning a breeze. I even add a splash to my protein shakes to enjoy a pick me up after a workout. I would recommend this to anyone who is tired of over paying for iced coffees in the morning,5
2281,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/11/2021,A different flavor than the roasts I typically drink but excellent quality and could not be more convenient. I needed a less-fussy coffee option for my pre-5am mornings but didn't want to invest in a single cup pod-style brewer. This fits the bill perfectly!,4
2282,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/11/2021,I am such a coffee snob and I was skeptical of trying Jot. Well I am just sad I didn’t get it sooner. It’s delicious and so customizable. It gives me the boost I need to get through the day! I will be a forever customer!,5
2283,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/11/2021,"I love that I can make coffee while I’m running out the door so quick, and it tastes awesome! My favorite way (so far) is iced with homemade vanilla sweet cream. So good!",5
2284,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/11/2021,"I thought this was just another Instagram gimmick, but I was really sold by the glasses that came with the coffee. When I tried Jot, I was legitimately surprised at how good it tasted - all of the fuss and none of the muss. The bottle is small and fairly expensive, although you obviously end up saving $ on Starbucks. This is something nice to have in the fridge on mornings when you're too tired to stand in front of the espresso maker frothing oatmilk. Give it a try.",5
2285,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/11/2021,I can now make the best iced coffee at home without it being watery! So glad I tried Jot!!,5
2286,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/11/2021,"This coffee is amazing! I mix 1 or 2 tbsp with my favorite protein shake and the best latte in the world. It's cheaper, healthier and tastes solo good. I'm obsessed!",5
2287,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/11/2021,Jot is deliciously smooth and flavorful coffee!! I prefer cold coffee and this was easy to make!,5
2288,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/11/2021,"I have tried so many different iced coffees, cold brews, hot coffees, etc. over the years. I want something that isn’t packed with sugar and calories, but is quick and easy to make as a busy toddler mama! This by far has been the smoothest, convenient coffee I’ve tried packed with a powerful non-jittery caffeine punch! I love the versatility of how it can be used (current favorite is cold with some froathed oat milk and maybe a little other flavor depending on my mood!) - but i get to craft it how i want. Lots of servings in the container since it only takes 1 TBSP and it feels like such a nice treat I look forward to. Will be getting this again!",5
2289,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/11/2021,Makes absolutely great iced coffee. Not bitter at all! Can’t wait to try as hot coffee in the fall.,5
2290,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/11/2021,"Was sick of waiting in the drive thru every morning before work … decided to give JOT a try and I’m glad that I did. It’s amazing, the taste is great! Another thing is like to mention is I have acid reflux pretty bad and coffee usually makes it worse BUT with JOT I’ve never had that issue— it’s not acidic. I highly recommend!",5
2291,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/11/2021,"The flavor is amazing, thank you so much I don’t have to go to Starbucks. What a great product!",5
2292,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/11/2021,"Love this coffee!! It’s so fast and easy to make iced coffee now! Living in Arizona, iced coffee is a staple of life… and Jot has made iced coffee so easy and delicious! Definitely gives me enough caffeine to make it through the day! But if I need another pick me up, it’s so fast to make another coffee! And the travel mug is brilliant!!",5
2293,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/11/2021,So good! Affordable and delicious! ,5
2294,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original (Trial),09/11/2021,Love this! I put 1 Tablespoon of Jot coffee in half to one cup of nut milk. Sometimes 1 Tablespoon Jot + Quest protein shake. These are my new addictions.,5
2295,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/11/2021,"I was spending $6 a day on nitro cold brew. Something had to change. Jot popped up and I decided to try it. So happy I did! It is so good. Def a bit stronger than I was expecting, which is a great thing. Love it!",5
2296,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/11/2021,This is a quick and tasty way for an afternoon boost when you only have a minute between zoom calls!,5
2297,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/11/2021,Mom and I are huge coffee addict and these were amazing,5
2298,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/11/2021,Jot is my new favorite coffee!,5
2299,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/11/2021,"The flavor of the coffee is bold and very aromatic. I was drinking DD iced coffee for years (I know what was i thinking) and I will no longer, Jot will now be my coffee of choice.",5
2300,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/10/2021,"Very good and strong ,truthfully I was very surprised that little amount of coffee was that strong.*****",5
2301,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/10/2021,I’ve only tried the regular so far but Jot coffee tastes great! It’s a fresh coffee taste without any bitterness. I really love how convenient it is. It makes making a cup of coffee or latte fast and easy. I purchased the spoon and it’s a great edition to my new Jot coffee routine. I would definitely recommend this coffee to friends and family.,5
2302,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/10/2021,"Smooth, silky and delicious",5
2303,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/10/2021,"A little more mellow than the black jot, great for a wake up during work",5
2304,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/10/2021,"Not all mornings are in our favor. When you’re pressed for time and scrambling to get ready to go, Jot makes it easy for that caffeine fix while you’re running out the door.",5
2305,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/10/2021,For under $2 a cup it's a no brainer! Great taste (have yet to try hot),5
2306,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/10/2021,I live in rural Alaska. The closest coffee shop is over 200 miles away. Having Jot means morning iced lattes with zero effort. Forever a customer!,5
2307,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/10/2021,"Jot coffee is delicious hot or cold and very convenient to make!
My daughter has ulcerative colitis and cannot drink regular brewed coffee, but she can have half a tablespoon of Jot with no problem!
We love it!",5
2308,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/10/2021,"Makes mornings so much better - lovely flavor, really wonderful to have the ease of making hot or cold coffee drinks so easily every morning.",5
2309,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/10/2021,I love how fast and easy it was to make. Didn’t take much time at all.,5
2310,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/10/2021,I was worried that it was going to be just ok - but I like it a lot.,5
2311,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/10/2021,"I’m an avid coffee drinker, and would spend hundreds of dollars every month going through the drive thru a few times a day. Every. Single. Day. Now, I’m skeptical and tend to really dislike bottled coffees. They always have a weird taste or mouthfeel to them. So, I poured my first spoonful of Jot into a glass with extra creamy oatmilk, water, a splash of butter pecan syrup, ice, and hoped for the best without having high hopes at all. I was SOLD on Jot from that first sip! How can such a small amount have such a HUGE FLAVOR!? I’m now a whole bottle down and onto my second, bumping up my auto shipment so I won’t run out!",5
2312,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/10/2021,Really happy with the dark blend... even happier with not having to make coffee in the morning.,5
2313,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/10/2021,This makes me so happy.,5
2314,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/10/2021,Before Jot I’ve never seen coffee sold like this before and wanted to give it a try. I am so happy I did. It made making iced coffee so much easier.,5
2315,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/10/2021,"I've been searching for the best at home cold brew solution and I think I've finally found it. It's strong, it's delicious, I only need a little. It's perfect!",5
2316,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/10/2021,"convenient, tasty, and just enough caffeine. will purchase again",5
2317,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/10/2021,"So let’s me honest, I usually forget to write reviews unless something was unsatisfactory…. But jot is so easy and delish that I bought two extra bottles after the first sip.",5
2318,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/10/2021,"Jot was great. I drink a lot of coffee and it gave me an option to hop downstairs while working from home and make one in <1 min and be back to work, vs waiting for my machine to heat up or brew a full pot. Flavor is good even for me who loves a strong taste, but can always just add a bit more to my cup 😉",5
2319,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/10/2021,"I don’t drink a ton of coffee, so this is perfect for me rather than making a whole pot. I haven’t tried the dark version yet but I bet it’s equally as good.",5
2320,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/10/2021,"I always drink iced coffee even during cold winter, and this is so much easier than using a nespresso machine to make any kind of iced coffee and it tastes pretty good as well.",5
2321,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/10/2021,Love it have a great taste easy to make,5

2323,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/10/2021,"I was slightly dubious about trying Jot, but I loved it from the very first cup. Not only is it delicious, it is so easy and saves me a ton of time.",5
2324,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/10/2021,"Smooth, rich, unadulterated espresso in a bottle. Best and easiest iced latte of my life!",5
2325,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/10/2021,"Absolutely delicious, arrived in 5 days and now I have to order more. It's just a really good coffee you can prepare at home in seconds.

Mug it comes with is complete trash though, spills when you shake.",5
2326,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/10/2021,To say we are obsessed with Jot would be an understatement! It’s a great flavor without being over powering or upsetting to the stomach as other coffee products can be. We can’t wait to keep drinking Jot for years to come!,5
2327,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/10/2021,This is perfect for a quick and tasty coffee that provides the energy I need to start the day. I appreciate the strength of thr coffee and it looks like this will be my go to coffee on the daily.,5
2328,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/10/2021,"Love the convenience of Jot, especially in making iced coffee. I was running to Dunkin almost 2 x day. This has saved me time and money, and the coffee is better!",5
2329,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/10/2021,"I wasn’t sure how this would taste because I’ve tried so many instant coffees or premade cold brews, I even make my own, but this tastes really good. It’s quickly become my go to morning coffee and I like it better than most coffee I buy at a coffee shop. It’s definitely has a lot of caffeine in it as well so it’ll definitely wake you right up.",5
2330,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/10/2021,Delicious and super easy to make.,5
2331,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/10/2021,I’ve gotten in to cold brew recently and absolutely love the flavors so much more than hot brewed coffee. The only problem is that it’s not easily made at a minutes notice. Jot is perfect cause it’s very convenient to make a cold brew coffee whenever you want,4
2332,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/10/2021,not only does it taste good it's also super convenient. I'm in no way a morning person so being able to need to take a few minutes to put together my morning coffee and be out the door on the way to work is the best.,5
2333,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/10/2021,"I was so skeptical about this coffee, but the taste and convenience totally changed my mind and now I'm hooked.

2340,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/10/2021,"This is the best coffee I have purchased. Most coffee concentrates are really bitter and are hard to water down correctly but Jot is so easy. It tastes delicious and smooth, so much so that I stopped using flavor shots which I ALWAYS use. I don't know that I will ever go back to coffee shop since what I am making at home is so much better.",5
2341,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original (Extra Bottle),09/10/2021,"Extremely convenient, delicious and saves you money at Starbucks! Lol",5

2343,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/10/2021,"I don’t typically leave reviews and I am very particular about my coffee. (I worked as a barista for two years) Taste-wise, I am very sensitive to bitter flavors and cannot usually drink light roast coffee without cream and sugar. Jot has me drinking their dark roast with just milk. It’s super easy to pull together and saves me so much time and money in the mornings!",5
2344,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/10/2021,Jot is amazing. The taste is great and you have an iced coffee in seconds.,5

2347,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/10/2021,I was pleasantly surprised by the great flavor. I honestly didn't expect to like it so much. It's a great fast way to make a cold coffee drink,5
2348,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/10/2021,It's pretty convenient for morning refresher in such busy days. Good taste and worth the money!,5
2349,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/10/2021,Was surprised that just a tablespoon of concentrated coffee could have such a nice strong taste. Enjoying it as iced coffee daily. Will definitely order again,5
2350,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/10/2021,I make jot lattes every morning now. It’s so easy to make and taste amazing. This is like the better draft latte since draft lattes are really hit or miss if the shop doesn’t clean the valves properly. Would highly recommend.,5
2351,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/10/2021,"I was buying cold brew in aluminum cans because I’m lazy in the mornings. Jot is a great, more sustainable alternative that tastes smooth and strong like espresso. I’m hooked!",5
2352,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/10/2021,Ordered on a whim. I like my coffee black with no sugar or cream. I drink this black or with a splash of milk and it tastes just like Starbucks,5

2354,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/10/2021,"Very convenient when I’m running late for work. It’s great to add to protein shakes. It’s nice that it doesn’t take up much room in the fridge. 150mg caffeine per tbsp is good buzz and makes it easy to calculate how much caffeine you want. Flavor is smooth, similar cold brew made in a Toddy. It’s slightly expensive for what it is, but you can’t beat the convenience.",5
2355,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/09/2021,Bought as a gift for my daughter for her first week of college. The package was originally lost and Jot stepped in and quickly replaced the order.

2359,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/09/2021,I read an article about this company and decided to give it a try. I drink coffee multiple times throughout the day every day of the week. I really enjoyed this brand of coffee. It tastes great and is not acidic at all. I highly recommend this coffee for daily consumption.,5
2360,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/09/2021,"Loved the coffees! I am an avid cold brew drinker, and I think this taste profile is very similar. I love that it’s so concentrated and I do feel like it gives me lots of energy. I think I am liking Dark more these days!",5
2361,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/09/2021,I ordered the regular and the dark and they are both great! I was looking for something to replace my Starbucks cold brew at a fraction of the cost. The dark has more of the Starbucks taste to me and will be my favorite from now on.,5

2363,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/09/2021,So easy and delicious! Tried it this morning while getting the kids to the bus stop. We were running a bit late but I didn't have to skip my coffee bc of JOT!,5
2364,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original (Trial),09/09/2021,"I’ve tried dozens of instant coffees and prebottled cold brews, all claiming to be just as good as fresh brewed coffee, and each time it was a dirty lie. I like my coffee strong and fresh tasting and I was prepared to be disappointed again…and this time I wasn’t! I just made my first cup of Jot, with one tablespoon stirred into 8 oz of cold oat milk, and then poured over ice…and it tasted like a real iced latte. A GOOD iced latte. Good enough that I immediately told my friends about it. And good enough that I groaned inwardly, because I know this not the most cost effective way to make coffee, but now that I know how easy it is and how good it is, I’ll be very tempted to use Jot most mornings. I’m surprised and glad I decided to try it.",5

2366,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/09/2021,"Jot is pure awesomeness in a cup. I tried Javy before this and was instantly hooked on the concentrated coffee craze. An advertisement for Jot and the Fellow mug caught my attention and I ordered it, knowing I wouldn’t be let down. It is unbelievably good and is the way to go for someone like me who is always on the go. Less waste with an even better taste. Pretty much every brand of canned coffee contains a ridiculous amount of sugar, most have carrageenan, and almost zero non-dairy options. With Jot, not only is it easy, but I can add whatever I want! I love to just mix a tablespoon of Jot with some oat milk. It’s my go-to and is so fast and easy. Thank you for fueling me!",5

Highly recommend.",5

2382,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/09/2021,Absolutely love the taste and the convenience!!,5
2383,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/09/2021,At first I hated it. Mixed it with water and my usual “toppings” and was so disgusted by what I had just tasted. I couldn’t believe it was as nasty as I had experienced but decided to give it another chance but this time mixed it with unsweetened vanilla almond milk and my usual toppings and then was like “ahhhh this is more like it!” It was banging and def have made several cups since then! Definitely will consider repurchasing! Thank you!,5

2386,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/09/2021,"I got ads for this product for a long time and was turned off by the idea of a concentrate I could water down.... but then they started doing a bundle deal with a thermos I had my eye on so I took the bait. I AM SO GLAD I DID! This coffee is smooth, bursting with flavor, and so easy to make. I don't have to clean my French Press at 7am anymore, or wake up my sleeping girlfriend with the sound of the grinder. Instead, I just heat water (or add cold!) and pour it together and run. It's also an unbeatable price for the amount of coffee it is. It's even easier than running for my free cup from the coffee shop I work! Seriously, take it from me. You want this product in your fridge. I'll be loyal for years to come. Thank you Jot!!",5

2390,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/09/2021,"Loved the taste. Me and my husband prefer dark coffee, and it was bold and dark enough for us. The only downfall was it is running out real quick. It is because we have been consistently drinking Jot coffee. So cannot blame them.",5

2393,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/09/2021,"I'm a big fan of the new Dark variety. It has the full coffee profile, not flat or missing anything like many cold brew concentrate products out there. It's perfect for iced flats and lattes, even black and hot.

Granted, the price reflects the quality a bit, but its's still 1/2-1/3 the price as buying at everyone's favorite drive-thru coffe spot--and the flavor is way better! Overall, great deal.",5
2394,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/09/2021,"I was looking for a new coffee option and stumbled upon this brand from an Instagram ad of all things. I was a little weary about ordering from them, but I bit the bullet and it was great. Got both the dark and original versions. I have found myself drinking it more as a hot drink, than a cold. 

Generally I prefer the cold coffee, but the taste of the hot is just soo good. Even found myself sitting on the patio watching my kids play in the yard and had a cup of hot coffee. II don't know why, but it seemed like a good thing to do at the time and while it was pretty blazing out, I had no complaints about the heat from my cup.",5
2395,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/09/2021,"Impressed with the quality and taste, love that you just add water, no more overnight brewing!",5

I've tried other cold brew concentrates and found that it was still too bitter for my liking, even with my milk and sugar, but not Jot.

2400,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/08/2021,"Really nice flavor and I'm very pleased with the suggestions on different beverages to make. Don't be fooled by the free thermos cup, it's not great quality and mine leaks EVERYWHERE. Even though the cup was garbage, the coffee is a great way to refresh in the afternoon. 

I would love suggestions on what continued use of the bottles looks like? or a return service for reuse-- they are the cutest bottles and I hate to just throw them in the recycle. 

Thanks, Jot!",4
2401,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/08/2021,"I wasn't sure what to expect but from the first sip, Jot hits all the right notes. It's key to keep the right ratios between coffee, water, ice, and milk depending on what you use, but that's old news if you already prep your own coffee at home.",5
2402,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/08/2021,I tried Javy and oneBy and Jot is by far my favorite! Tastes wonderful!,5

2405,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/08/2021,I was a little skeptical about 20x concentrate coffee since I've tried other concentrates before. And I was so wrong. Iced coffee is a must in AZ summers and this one is the best. Others I've tried taste like regular brewed coffee. But Jot doesn't have that burnt taste others have. I will definitely continue to buy and can't wait to try it hot as well.,5
2406,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/08/2021,"SUPER SURPRISED! Truly amazing. Can’t, or don’t want to go a morning without it! Love, love, love the flavor! Honestly love everything about it. A MUST try!",5

2414,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/08/2021,I purchased the regular and dark bottles as part of a promotion with a Fellow mug. I am really enjoying the coffee. I find it best iced with a small bit of creamer. But typically drink it black.,5
2415,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/08/2021,We love having iced coffee but it’s not easy to make with a regular coffee pot. Jot is tastes great and makes it so easy!,5

2420,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/08/2021,"Smooth, and sets well on my stomach. Caffeine is a little high for me, I have noticable jitter after drinking, so one use half a Jot spoon.

I’ve shared this with a coworker of mine and she also agrees that it’s one of the best coffee she’s had.",5

2429,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/08/2021,"I've been using a Kurig for years because you can't beat the consistency of each cup. But the non-reusable cups are so wasteful - and being an iced coffee lover, it was hard to have to wait for my perfect cup to cool down and then have to dilute it with ice. I love that with Jot, I'm able to get the same consistent cup of coffee (whichever temperature I want it) without making any trash.",5
2430,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/07/2021,"Made a great afternoon cup of cold brew, but as a hot coffee morning drinker, haven't quite locked down a good hot drink recipe with this, so far a classic cup with hot water or latte with frothed milk have been lacking from typical espresso brews.",4

I live in Minnesota and I like cold coffee, with some cold soy milk, all year round. A few months ago I tried Jot and my search was over. It was my favorite. A few weeks ago I found out about Jot dark and since i prefer dark coffee, I ordered some. Jot Dark is now my favorite! Thank you Jot!",5
2468,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/07/2021,"Better than any coffee shop I’ve tried and a fraction of the price, love this stuff!",5
2469,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/07/2021,"One of the best coffees I’ve ever drank. My husband was a little skeptical, but has now been asking for a cup each morning! Bonus, they ship to Hawaii (which is amazing since a lot of things don’t ship to Hawaii!) on my way to order another round!",5
2470,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/07/2021,The coffee was a real pick me up! Great taste too!,5
2471,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/06/2021,"When it is hot I prefer iced coffee. I hate paying 2 to 3 dollars for a cup at the drive through, or going without when I don't have access to a car. I have bought other systems to make iced coffee at home, but they were never as good. 
 The day after I received my Jot shipment, I tried it and it was awesome. Probably even better than the drive through. Thank you so much!",5
2472,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/06/2021,I was worried that a coffee concentrate was going to somehow taste weird but it has the boldness of a fresh cup. I boil my water & add a Tbsp and it tastes great! I was making my coffee in a French press before but this just made my morning easier.,5
2473,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/06/2021,I’m an iced coffee drinker. The dark was a bit strong - had to add a few extra ounces milk to it. Diluted the regular the same way. It’s the regular that I prefer. Couldn’t be easier to make. This could get me drinking coffee every day.,5
2474,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/06/2021,"I ordered Jot on a whim. What a great whim.... it is DELICIOUS. I make iced coffee and iced lattes with it and they are simply delicious. I have never had as good that is also organic at a coffee shop! I made my own vanilla syrup to compliment the Jot. My workdays are stressed filled and I am now anticipating 3:00 every day for my iced coffee break. I have never ordered anything on subscription, but this Jot... oh I'm subscribing!",5
2475,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/06/2021,"I was skeptical about the quality of this coffee because I’m used to espresso shots, but I was gladly surprised of the taste being so similar.

2479,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/06/2021,Super convenient but I was really hoping it was going to be smoother. It’s pretty sour :/ I was hoping I wouldn’t need anything but ice and water but the flavor is not pleasant alone.,3
2480,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/06/2021,This coffee I was kinda hesitant to try at first but randomly decided to give it a try one morning & i‘m so glad I did. It’s so simple & quite honestly is like a party in my mouth with the flavor ! I love it & will definitely be buying more,5
2481,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/06/2021,"I'm astounded by this little bottle of ultra coffee. Not only does it make a coffee-making machine unnecessary, but you do things you just cant with other coffees just by squeezing a few drops of this stuff into anything. I love drinking a spicy ginger beer - a little squirt of coffee drops the sweetness of the drink and adds that delicious coffee flavor (aside from being a wonderful afternoon pick-me-up). I can imagine using an eye-dropper to inject a little in almost any drink. And I'll be dripping a little over ice cream as well. With Jot, great coffee flavor goes into anything! Really excited to experiment!",5

2500,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/06/2021,"I was drawn to Jot because I thought it’d be a better tasting version of instant coffee - and I was correct! I wanted something like that because I’m a teacher, and very tight on time in the mornings, and so very often I don’t have time to brew a cup, even in my Keurig. And on top of that, I definitely then don’t have time to make iced coffee. This is an easy way to get both! I used to just use premade cold brew or make bags myself, and I still like doing that too, but it didn’t feel very cost effective - with this, I can get a lot of bang for my buck, which I really appreciate. And again, it tastes great! My black-coffee-loving bf’s favorite way to drink it is to take a “shot” of it without mixing water, and he says it has him set for the day 😂 (noooot recommended by me).",5

2502,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/06/2021,"I’m an everyday (multiple times a day), coffee drinker. I’m not the biggest hot coffee fan, especially in the summer months where it’s into the 100 degrees. I’ve hunted for cold brews that I can just have at home in an effort to save money and not buy a single cup everyday at a big chain. After trying several bottled companies, brewing my own, and out of desperation, trying a cold brew powder instant coffee, I started to lose hope. 

Now to be fair, when Jot came across my Instagram feed as an ad, I was skeptical. So many of the ads are this gimmicks and meant to draw you in with this cool, trendy ad. Then they give you some junk that resembles nothing of what you saw in the ad. 

Jot is not that company. This is honestly a delicious cup of coffee. I keep a bottle at work and one at home. It’s smooth. I started with the recommended 1TBS to 8oz of water as a baseline, but honestly you can adjust it to your taste which is just icing on the cake. 

Let me save you time and some money by saying, don’t go buy another bottled brand, get some Jot and you’ll be grateful.",5

The coffee itself tastes pretty good. It doesn't rise up to fancy NYC coffeeshop lattes, but also I'm not a barista. I use it for cold brews and it's excellent there, haven't gone back to the local shop for a cold brew since I got the Jot bottles. I got the free Fellows mug, which is amazing btw, and keeps the coffee cold all day. The ice is still making noise after the cup is empty, for hours. I have tried another coffee concentrate brand that also starts with a J, and Jot is way better. My only complaint is that they don't make a decaf. Please make a decaf.",5

2614,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/04/2021,"This is by far, the best coffee concentrate I have ever tasted. It’s very very smooth, not acidic at all, which I found common in coffee products. Bonus: I love the size and portability, not to mention the ease and convenience. Right now my favorite method is adding it to my Yeti tumbler with cold filtered water and some Laird Creamer.

3.) Measure out 1.5Tbs of Jot and a splash of cream into a travel mug.
4.) Pour hot water while running handheld electric milk frother.
5.) Enjoy a zero cleanup and a perfect cup of coffee 


Literally takes 5 minutes to walk out the door in the morning and I couldn’t be happier with the switch to Jot!",5
2678,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original (Trial),09/03/2021,"Very good coffee, but a little out of my budget!",5
2679,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/03/2021,It's great! Not bitter or sour and I love that I can customize how much or how little I want!!,5
2680,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/02/2021,"Great taste. Richer, bolder.",5
2681,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/02/2021,Love it! ,5
2682,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/02/2021,"I was skeptical about basically fancy instant coffee, but this stuff is actually amazing! I love a good Starbucks anything, and this is really, really close to that but in half the time and whenever I want. It's a little on the pricier side, so it's a treat for me to have, but I love it! I am definitely thinking about a subscription.",5
2683,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original (Trial),09/02/2021,"It was ok. Not bad, nothing special.",3
2684,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/02/2021,Impressed with the ease of pouring a cup. Good flavor. Nice bottle and secure cap.,5
2685,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original (Trial),09/02/2021,"I think this coffee is very good for what it is. In fact, I made a cup of instant coffee (something I never drink) right after for comparison, and it was most certainly terrible by comparison. Jot has a nice ""correct"" coffee flavor to it. It is cleanly made, and has good acidity, and decidedly fruity notes. Having said that, it is rather monolithic and lacks the depth of flavor or richness one gets in brewed coffee. I think this would be an excellent thing to take along for a weekend (or week) getaway somewhere where you didn't have a coffee maker and/or grinder and wanted a decent cup of coffee. I don't see this replacing brewing coffee with fresh ground beans (which honestly only takes about 2 min of work) but I think it has a place. Nice product that appears to be made with great effort and care. Probably about as good as it can be for what it is.",3
2686,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/02/2021,LOVE,5
2687,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/02/2021,It is worth it!,5
2688,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/02/2021,"I was a little skeptical honestly, but wow this coffee is great! I’ve tried it in milk and water and mixed depending on what consistency I want it and love it. I am hooked on cold brew/ iced coffee and this is IT. A splash of vanilla flavoring and YES. I love how easy it is.
Also the Fellow mug is adorable! Mine was dented, but Jot was quick to replace it when I reached out.",5
2689,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/02/2021,I always saw ads for this on instagram and needed an easy iced coffee fix to save money in grad school. Jot really did the job and exceeded my expectations!,5
2690,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original (Trial),09/02/2021,I like to drink 16 oz of coffee - So I use 2 Tbs. Sure it's more expensive but it's well worth the expense. When you think of how a 8 oz Red Bull cost around $2 dollars. I'm down with paying the money for such an awsome cup of coffee. It might be a while before I go back to grinding my coffee again. Well done JOT! You rock!,5
2691,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/02/2021,"Even after reading all the positive reviews, I expected this to be decent but not my ""go-to"" coffee. I expected that I'd bring it with me when traveling and when I didn't want to spend the money on Starbucks or something similar. But man, after a few cups, I really do think this will replace my regular cold brew routine. The coffee is smooth as **** and I end up using far less creamer than I usually do. It's legitimately really good. Give it a shot.",5
2692,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/02/2021,So good. I make it in the morning and pack it up for work. Stays cold and delicious until I enjoy in the afternoon 💕,5
2693,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/02/2021,YUM!!!,5
2694,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/02/2021,"I'm a sucker for Starbucks, but my bank account is not. This allows me to have a fabulous latte from home for wayyy less.

Only thing is, I wish I had gotten the measuring spoon.",5
2695,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/02/2021,Strong without the taste one gets when water is evaporated from coffee.,5
2696,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/02/2021,"Finally got around to ordering and trying Jot coffee! I am a loyal customer of another concentrated at home coffee brand but I just had to give Jot a chance!
Turns out its delish! And a HUGE plus is that it takes up basically no space in the refrigerator! Being that my coffee addiction is pretty thru the roof I wish their glass bottles came in bigger sizes, so I dont have to order all these mini ones.. but thats not really a complain, just an idea. 
Great job Jot! Ill be back :)",5
2697,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/02/2021,"Well, in a spoon, because it was all it took from the bottle to the mug to create a delicious, bold coffee. Really loved it, looking forward to try it with milk, hot, etc :)",5
2698,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/02/2021,My wife and I love the flavor and convenience.,5
2699,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/02/2021,"It makes AMAZING iced drinks but I wasn’t too sold on the hot black coffee, the hot latte is better. Might just be a preference thing!",4
2700,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/02/2021,I love food and I am a lazy cook. I love coffee and I hate making it and cleaning up after in almost equal measure. Jot is both delicious and easy so it suits me perfectly.,5
2701,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/02/2021,"I take my coffee black and sweet, and love cold brew when its warm out. I've been disappointed in the flavor of cold brews & concentrates at the grocery store, but Jot is delicious! I love how space saving the small bottles are, and how much flavor (and caffeine!) they pack in!",5
2702,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/02/2021,"Love the JOT coffee. Just add two table spoons, salted Carmel creamer or syrup and almond milk then stir/I shake and pour over ice 😋.",5
2703,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/02/2021,"I can be skeptical of new coffee brands, but this is really good!! It’s strong and delicious, plus it’s easy to make. I love it!!",5
2704,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/02/2021,"This stuff is the real deal. After my first order, I turned around and ordered three more bundles to have a good supply in my pantry. Also ordered extra to gift to fellow coffee drinkers. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys a smooth coffee!",5
2705,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/02/2021,Really enjoyed waking up to a super quick and easy to make cup of cold coffee this past week with Jot!,5
2706,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/02/2021,Makes my morning so much smoother!,5
2707,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/02/2021,"I’m going to be honest—I fell for the Instagram marketing and the deal where you received a free Fellow mug with purchase. I love my Fellow mug, and wanted another. Upon arrival, I was pleasantly surprised with how easy it was and how good the coffee tasted. It also gives me a good caffeine buzz, which I find is sometimes lacking in similar products. I will likely reorder! One tip: don’t use more milk/water than suggested unless you also add more coffee concentrate. Too much milk easily dilutes the coffee flavor.",5
2708,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/02/2021,"I was wary of this -- seemed like it could not possibly be good but it's very good! I didn't like it hot, but it makes a delicious cold brew. Perhaps a bit too convenient -- easy to drink too many! I also love my new Fellow mug!",4
2709,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/02/2021,Amazing,5
2710,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/02/2021,I sometimes need an extra boost at work and when i tried this and it helps get me thru the day.,5
2711,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/02/2021,"I like it a lot and have been using it for morning coffee smoothies. It is true, you only need a tablespoon to match a cup of coffee. My only comment, and this is probably more about me than the coffee, is that since I'm a caffeine junky, I find that one tablespoon to be not nearly enough and will routinely measure out 3-4 tablespoons. It certainly boosts the cost way up for me, but it's really good.",4
2712,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/02/2021,"Hey there,

These days it's hard to find quality products that I can trust, and even more difficult to find companies that I can believe in and feel good about supporting. Jot seems to be one of those unicorns. 

My husband and I are huge cold brew fans, especially in the summer.. which is the majority of the year here in north Texas. While I enjoy the process of making just about anything, I've found myself severely lacking the time to do so since our daughter was born. Jot simplifies the coffee necessity in my life and I'm a huge fan of that.",5
2713,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/01/2021,I just with the bottles were bigger. I went through one in a week.,4
2714,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/01/2021,I love this coffee. It’s bold but smooth. No bitterness and tastes great either cold or hot. I love that it’s super easy to mix and grab and go. What a great product. Already have turned several friends into your product.,5
2715,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/01/2021,Only downside is bottles are small,5
2716,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/01/2021,"Was a little reserved in ordering some of the coffee because I havent had good experiences with Instagram ads, but im glad I took the chance. Love the coffee! Makes early mornings and long days easy!",5
2717,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original (Trial),09/01/2021,I only used one-half tablespoon in 6oz coffee mug and it was perfect. I can hardly wait to bake something that calls for coffee!,5
2718,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/01/2021,"I am not an every day coffee drinker, but the ease of making a cup in the morning is turning me into one! Plus the taste is hard to beat, smooth without any bitterness.",5
2719,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original (Trial),09/01/2021,I’m loving Jot so far! It’s so convenient to make a coffee and it’s delicious. Can’t wait until it’s cool enough outside to drink it warm!,5
2720,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original (Trial),09/01/2021,"My wife and I were very pleased with our first bottle of Jot coffee. Wondered how a single tablespoon of the liquid could yield a full bodied cup of coffee, but it did! We both love the taste and will definitely order more.",5
2721,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/01/2021,"The main pro of Jot is that it is easy and fast! If I am in a rush or too lazy to grind coffee beans, I only need to warm up some water, take this out of the fridge and done! The taste is good too, it is definitely not the best coffee I have ever drink, but good enough. Main con, I do think it is pretty expensive... but if you have the money and are short on time it is one of the best options I have tried.",4
2722,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/01/2021,"I work in a theatre. Even hot water is sometimes a struggle. The only way to grab a decent coffee is to send someone out with your credit card. Having JOT inside by my bag makes a great cup no longer a struggle, Love it.",5
2723,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/01/2021,Super smooth and love the taste. Its my favorite morning cup that i have found,5
2724,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/01/2021,This has been the easiest way to make coffee and I love the refreshing taste. It's a great alternative to a long coffee making process that easy to adjust and get addicted to.,5
2725,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/01/2021,I really enjoy the coffee. Th flavor is great. I wish you made caffine free so I could drink it in the evening.,5
2726,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original (Trial),09/01/2021,"Just drinking my first glass of iced coffee. Really good, I will be a continuing customer. Also going to order a bottle for my daughter.",5
2727,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/01/2021,"I first came across Jot via an Instagram ad, so, obviously, I was judgment. This is one of the few times that I'm glad I went against my judgement. When you're in a rush in the morning, Jot really comes to the rescue getting you your daily caffeine boost in just a few seconds. The great taste is a plus.",5
2728,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/01/2021,"Really like the taste (very smooth, not bitter) but also love how easy it is to make my iced coffee in the morning with Jot. It's faster than brewing a pot!",5
2729,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/01/2021,Delicious and quick.,5
2730,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/01/2021,I just got my 1st shipment of Jot and I’m loving it! The taste is incredible but the best part is how easy and convenient it makes my morning cup of coffee. I travel a lot for work and hate using the hotel room coffee makers. I’ve been bringing my Aeropress along on my trips to be able to get a good cup in the morning but now I have a great alternative! Jot takes up much less space and will be a wonderful way to enjoy coffee again on the road!,5
2731,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/01/2021,"This is by far the best iced coffee concentrate I have ever had! It doesn’t have the bitter bite like some do. It taste very strong but in a smooth way. Once mixed with oat milk, brown sugar and vanilla, I couldn’t go back to any other concentrated coffee.

I will never buy anything else again and am so glad I found this coffee!!!",5
2732,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/01/2021,"Jot coffee is great at home, on the road (waaaay better than hotel coffee and travels well), with ice and water, hot water, or Joi cashew milk. Depending on how I feel, the strength is easy to change. I can't wait to try the new dark.",5
2733,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original (Trial),09/01/2021,I love Jot and also love the cool glass bottle it comes in. I will definitely reuse!,5
2734,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/01/2021,I ordered the original and dark with mug. I am usually not a dark strong coffee drinker but these both have such an amazing flavor. It is so easy to make the best iced coffee right here at home. The cup keeps it ice cold and super hot if I use it for hot coffee. A little goes a long way. I am so glad I made this purchase and will buy again.,5
2735,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/01/2021,So easy to get going in the morning! Taste great and I can mix it with my protein shake and it taste just like one of those “fancy” coffee store drinks.,5
2736,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/01/2021,"Delicious, simple to make and super customizable!",5
2737,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/01/2021,Love JOT!!! My husband and I are coffee fiends. We have been trying to find something just like Jot and cannot rave about them more to our friends. The original is our go to but the dark… so delicious as well - really hits you with that coffee house coffee flavor and taste.,5
2738,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/01/2021,"Love this! I stopped making myself coffee in the mornings because my usual pourover/aeropress cups were a bit too much of a hassle and often too strong for my lowered caffeine tolerance. Love that making coffee with Jot takes literal seconds out of my day, I get to choose the strength of my cup of coffee by using however much of the concentrate that I want, and the result is delicious and smooth with absolutely no bitterness. Ended up buying another set for my boyfriend too enjoy because this is too good not to share.",5
2739,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/01/2021,"I was skeptical, as I’m kind of a coffee snob, but I bought this for work, and it is as good as a nice cup of coffee from a cafe. AND SO EASY! No more instant coffee on camping trips for me. I’ve tried too-shelf instants and coffee bags, but this is by far the best solution for having good coffee when you can’t or don’t want to actually brew coffee.",5
2740,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/01/2021,I usually pull my own shots of espresso but this is perfect for lazy days or when I’m out of beans. Packs a punch and has a great smooth taste,5
2741,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,09/01/2021,"I was doubtful about some of the reviews, but it is indeed smooth and makes a great, fast cup of iced coffee. I would recommend.",5

2746,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/31/2021,Its really delicious. But it doesnt last long at all for just an expensive bottle because I go through it so fast! Makes great iced coffee.,4
2747,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/31/2021,"I love JOT! It’s been a game changer for me in the 
Morning. I make myself an iced vanilla latte and it’s super quick and tastes amazing. Worth it!",5

I’ve had Original Jot before and thought I’d give Dark a try. Overall, I really like the flavor and it is so smooth to drink, and I’m not quite ready for the total boldness. I will be subscribing to the Original and I will come back for more Dark when I’m ready!",4
2756,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/31/2021,super tasty and makes mornings easy. just a bit pricy at the moment per glass,4

2760,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,08/31/2021,"Has none of the bitter, burnt taste that instant coffee has. Tastes like a homemade americano!",5
2761,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/31/2021,"I rarely have space in my fridge for a cold brew container so I’ve been looking for a different option. When I saw the ad for Jot I thought I’d give it a try as the bottles would fit in more easily. 

When the coffee came I loved the packaging. Even though it was shipped the bottles and the box they came in were good a new and the product packaging was subtle and elegant. 

 I’m not going to lie. When I saw how thick it looked I was a little put off but I figured I would give it a try and I am glad I did. We started with an iced latte using 2 tbsp of the coffee to 16oz of oat milk over ice. The coffee was delicious and had just the right amount of strength and it was easy to combine with the milk. As a bonus it only took seconds to make 

By far my favorite way to drink jot though it 1 tbsp of Jot pored Over ice with 8oz of tonic slowly poured over the top before giving it a quick stir. It takes seconds to make but the coffee flavour is rich, deep and Smokey without being bitter and it holds up beautifully over the tonic.",5

Set up a quick Jot coffee station behind the front desk with a bucket of ice and cold filtered water. My co-worker and I took our first sip (gulp) together and exclaimed in unison how amazing and necessary it was. Curious clients came up to see what our excitement was about and at the sound of ice cubes clinking in our tall mugs. We gave them real time props and review of Jot: Smooth, clean, refreshing, energizing and the best wake-your ***-up-and-get-in-done feeling. Thank you!",5

2789,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/30/2021,"As a person who prefers iced coffee, Jot has been a great find. Previously, I used to make a pot of hot coffee, let it cool down for several minutes, and then add ice to the cup. With Jot, my iced coffee process is a lot faster. I simply add the tablespoon of Jot to a tall glass, fill with water and ice, and I'm ready to go. Tastes great and my iced coffee is ready in 60 seconds. I recommend trying it out.",5
2790,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,08/30/2021,"A tablespoon legit tastes like a shot, with the richness and aroma of an espresso. Exceeded my expectations for sure and made coffee at home so much easier.",5

2794,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/30/2021,"Before Jot, I'd only had the occasional cup of coffee with friends. However, my career is changing, and with that, I need caffeine, which is low on calories and easy to access. I appreciate Jot for the ease in making a cup of coffee, which I can then flavor, strengthen, or dilute accordingly. I found the taste to be surprisingly nice and smooth, even as a first-time coffee drinker, and will certainly be purchasing more to fuel my efficient lifestyle!",5

2796,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,08/30/2021,"I just tried my first cup of Jot yesterday and was very happy with it! I did note that the instructions indicate 1tbs Jot per 8oz water. I used the 1tbs in a mug and added hot water. I didn’t stop to think about the fact that mugs today hold more than just 8oz of water and so my coffee was a little weaker than what I prefer. It was still good, but I’m thinking today that I’ll just add a bit more Jot to my morning coffee!",5
2797,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,08/30/2021,"I love the flavor, love the convenience, and love the options! Jot is my new ‘go to’ and I can’t wait to buy more as gifts! 😄",5

2819,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/30/2021,"This is tasty coffee, period. I love the taste of cold brew. With jot, I can have full bodied iced coffee in 60 seconds and it's delicious. Once the weather cools down, I'll only have to wait as long as long as the water takes to boil for a hot cup to start the day.
The taste is outstanding and convenience is beyond. Love the ethical commitments of Jot too.",5
2820,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/30/2021,"I was a little hesitant to try this, as I was raised in a coffee loving household. Not making the coffee every morning seemed a little foreign. I decided to take a chance here because I’ve been wanting to make an easier, tastier iced coffee at home. I am so happy with this purchase! Not only can I get a glass of coffee ready in a minute or less, it really is delicious. I’ve begun experimenting more with different flavors since it’s so easy to make the base coffee. The only issue I had with my order was that I did order with the intention of also getting the 2 Fellow Stagg Glasses. After placing my order, I was told they actually didn’t have those glasses in stock. While I was disappointed, I was reached out to by Cara on their support team and the issue was resolved. They sent out the iced Jot glasses instead, which I also like a lot, but am disappointed I couldn’t get a glass that handles hot and cold bevs. The service was excellent though in handling that issue, so I am still impressed and I love their product!",5
2821,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/30/2021,"I was very surprised at how delicious Jot is. I made a few different types to test the suggested recipes. All were so easy and tasted great! I am curious about recycling the lovely glass bottles. It seems like such a waste of good packaging. Maybe a return the bottles when you order again kind of thing. Either way, great job!!!",5

2823,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,08/30/2021,"Hey Andrew,

Appreciate the opportunity to express some feedback. I love the concept of Jot and the actual taste of the coffee..:.when I tried a drop or two of the concentrated liquid. However, for me personally, I thought with the suggested 1Tsp to 8 oz of water ratio, I felt like the taste and boldness was quite lacking. So for my next cup, I upped it to a teaspoon and a half and finally 3 teaspoons to get my desired taste and boldness for cold brew coffee. I’d like to keep ordering but for the price and the amount that I would desire per cup would ultimately in the long run make buying from Jot not as financially great as initially imagined. I was wondering if you have other customers asking for increased flavor or boldness as well. 

Thanks again, 
Harwin",4

Being pretty picky about coffee beverages, I have never bought anything pre-made-in-a-jar before this. Jot coffee is totally different than anything else I have ever tried. Smooth, potent, easy.

I've used it almost every day since I purchased it and just ordered two more bottles, one dark and one original.

It's difficult to not have 3 cups a day, it's that good! I'll have to dig for more recipes and am happy to have something to keep me energized. Thank you, Jot, and keep up the great work!

2888,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/28/2021,"I purchased this on a package deal with a nice little insulated cup. The pair of them are awesome! I take a cup of coffee with me to work every night. Usually a couple hours in, the coffee is cold and bitter. Not with Jot. With the little cup that it came with, my coffee stays hot and drinkable all night! And for iced coffee, it is awesome too! Thanks for making coffee a great thing again.",5

2896,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/28/2021,Coffee is very convenient for work life but the taste of it is not the best. Not to my liking it is a little too sour.,3
2897,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/28/2021,Great tasting coffee but also great for frequent travelers! Hotel coffee is never strong enough or lacks taste. Jot lets me have a great iced coffee everyday without having to find an expensive coffee shop while traveling. I’ve even been drinking it at home too now!,5
2898,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/28/2021,Coffee tastes great and is so easy to prep in the morning! Will continue to buy.,5
2899,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/28/2021,"This is simply the best way to drink coffee. It is super easy to use, it will save you lots of money on ride to the coffee shop, gas and it is delicious! I have instant hot water at home so it is super easy to make latte, mocha, or just black. My guests loved it and I can store my French presse or keurig machine for good. No more $7 lattes (w/ nut milk). Thank you Jot!",5
2900,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/28/2021,I am a black coffee drinker and this is so delicious and smooth. Great Flavor and simplifies my morning routine!!,5

2908,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/28/2021,"I have a hard time fighting the urge to drink Jot coffee. I really enjoy it cold, especially with oat milk. At the same time, I did expect it to come with a spoon for portioning.",5
2909,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/28/2021,"I’m now the most requested Ultra Coffee barista in my home. Constantly searching for ways to present the coffee better, the taste is a guarantee. Cheers.",5
2910,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/28/2021,"I wasn't sure what to think of Jot for a long time because it sounded like a ""hot coffee"" replacement and I am a cold brew die-hard (most of the year at least). I also have always been skeptical that things like this are just coffee ""flavored"" but wouldn't taste like the real deal. All my fears couldn't have been further from the truth. This is GOOD coffee. Hot, iced, however you want it, it is delicious, strong, smooth, and with all the right notes. I appreciate the super concentrate because it reduces shipping weight as well. I am a fan!",5
2911,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/27/2021,I was a skeptic until I took my first drink of my iced white mocha with Joy Coffee. I must say I dislike making coffee but Jot is so easy and delicious. Will be ordering again soon.,5

2913,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/27/2021,This makes the most amazing iced coffee I've ever had! Can't wait to try it hot!,5
2914,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/27/2021,I only like for iced coffee. For hot coffee I will continue to use my keurig. But since I prefer cold brew in general..it works for me! It is definitely one of or if not the best cold brews I have had! I was a little distraught because I thought I was getting 2 jots and a free mug but it only came with 1 coffee and a mug. It looks like the two coffee:mug special is about $8 more which I would have definitely paid for as that’s a much better deal! I don’t know what went wrong.,4
2915,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/27/2021,Great quality coffee and super convenient when you are on the go!,5
2916,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/27/2021,"I love the taste of the coffee! Jot is now my go-to for making ice coffee, just add a splash of milk & enjoy! They have great customer service as well in case there are issues with the order/shipment.",5
2917,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/27/2021,"I bought a trial bottle because it sounded interesting. “Interesting"" is a understatement! I use Jot in several recipes now and keep experimenting. Great coffee - no work! I am on my third order.",5

This was my daily morning drink till 1:00 pm. Knew I needed to make a change. I am an occasional Ice Coffee drinker. Saw Jot at a time I was making some changes, and love it. I make mine first this in the morning with Almond Milk and few drops of vanilla extract over crushed ice! To get a second serving, I sometimes fill half of my first glass with water snd more crushed ice! It’s been a game changer, after just a week, stopped taking heart but. Prescription meds, and feel great!",5
2922,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/27/2021,Love the coffee. Love love love the coffee. A little too expensive for a daily coffee. Wish I could afford it but I am on social security.,5
2923,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/27/2021,"Loved Jot coffee, I’ve been seeing ads for it on my Instagram for some time and really happy I finally bought it to try! I love mixing it with milk and ice for an iced latte or making a quick Vietnamese iced coffee. Will certainly be ordering more!!!",5
2924,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Dark,08/27/2021,"I love this stuff! Smooth, rich, flavorful coffee without the bitterness I usually taste from coffee I make with beans. It makes a particularly delicious iced coffee. The bottle and packaging are lovely. Also, fantastic as a gift. Love, love, love.",5
2925,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/27/2021,"I did enjoy my first iced coffee. 
I like sweet, so I added stevia, and used almond milk.",5
2926,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/27/2021,"I was skeptical about trying this but it was @Goodrecos approved so I gave it a shot. Just one tablespoon, cold water and a splash of creamer and it's the perfect early morning treat. 

Yesterday after just 2 sips, I felt much more awake and ready for the day. Highly recommend.",5

2929,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/27/2021,"I am a mom to a 2.5 year old boy and a 9 month old boy, we are a busy house! So many morning I felt I needed coffee in order to make my coffee. Insert Jot, it is not only simple but delicious! I also love that I can easily enjoy a cup of iced coffee while my husband has a cup of hot coffee. So happy I found this!",5
2930,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/27/2021,Easy and convenient just add to cold water and add my favorite creamer and it's like magic... perfect cold brew at home,5
2931,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/27/2021,"I saw Jot on instagram and thought I'd give it a try...I am so glad I did. This stuff is amazing. You can make coffee as strong or as light as you want; just a tablespoon into a thermos of ice water and you have BOMB iced coffee. It is so easy, so simple, and one of my favorite recent purchases. Definitely give it a try if you are on the fence. I have one bottle at home and one in the mini-fridge at my office. This stuff is excellent.",5
2932,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/27/2021,"I'm very frugal and was hesitant to try Jot, but I decided to purchase as a small reward for a small accomplishment. I'm SO glad I did. This coffee is as delicious as it is easy. I don't usually like strong coffee as I drink it black, but Jot is so rich and smooth it reminds me of dark chocolate. No bitterness or harshness. 
Unbelievably easy to make too. At my office, I can just use the hot water dispenser on our water 'cooler,' add Jot, stir and I'm enjoying delicious, fresh coffee that hasn't been on the heater for who knows how long?
I usually don't go to coffee shops, because I don't like very strong coffee and don't enjoy their flavors, so this is better than anything I've ever gotten from a coffee shop. I'm introducing all my friends to it and can't wait for that first cup in the morning.
I was lucky enough to get the free Fellow travel mug with purchase of two bottles of Jot and it's incredible! The ceramic-lined interior has shown me how much the stainless steel of most coffee mugs affects the flavor of my coffee.
Love, love, love.",5
2933,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/27/2021,I would drink energy drinks as a quick easy way to start my work day. I tried other quick coffee products and it didn’t taste good or took too many steps to make for someone on the go. Jot is a much healthier option and it taste really good. Like having g a good fresh cup of coffee or cold brew every time. Jot really starts my day,5
2934,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/27/2021,"I have an espresso machine at home, but this just made my life a million times easier when I have to run out quickly in the morning. Just add this to some oat milk and ice, and it’s the perfect latte!",5
2935,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/27/2021,The flavor is great! Not bitter. Super smooth. One tablespoon is truly all you need to make an 8oz cup. Coffee usually isn't enough so I've turned to energy drinks. This is a pretty good alternative!,5
2936,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/27/2021,"I thought this coffee was super good and convenient too. I plan on going on a trip soon and it is hard to bring your own coffee, now all I need is some water or milk and a glass. Which is much easier to find. Thanks!",5
2937,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/27/2021,"I have recently started drinking jot and am beyond taken by this coffee solution. I always hated having to go out and constantly buy cold brew, and the immense amount of space it took up in my refrigerator. With jot, I have a great tasting solution with none of the hassle!",5
2938,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/27/2021,It was love at first sip! I tend to be a coffee snob but Jot is right up there with the coffee shop down the street! It’s so nice to have coffee that is so good at home without having the expensive espresso machine!,5
2939,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/27/2021,The aroma. The taste!!!!!!! The color when you add oat milk 👌👌👌👌,5
2940,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/26/2021,"I love the versatility of Jot! Whether I’m feeling a cold brew, a latte, an iced latte, etc, Jot is perfect! It’s delicious and quick.",5

2943,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/26/2021,I am a working mom that don't have much time in the morning to even brew a pot of coffee. Jot really saves me tons of time every morning and the most important is it taste even better than the brew coffee I used to make. Life saver!,5
2944,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/26/2021,"I am really enjoying this coffee, iced and hot, the flavor is nice and clean. I don’t feel jittery after it’s great! I also love my Fellow mug : )

2945,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/26/2021,I really liked how smooth and tasty the coffee is. I particularly like an iced latte made with Jot.,5
2946,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/26/2021,I was very impressed. I think this is my new go-to coffee. I couldn’t be easier. I love the flexibility Jot offers. My only complaint is the price.,4
2947,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/26/2021,I love Jot! Tastes great and so easy to make. Especially for busy moms like myself. I will be ordering more!,5
2948,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/26/2021,"I was skeptical... so many coffees taste burnt/bitter, like Starbucks. Jot was just perfect! I like it because I don't have to deal with messy pods at work!
Hot or cold - just too easy! Loved the little white thermos too!",5
2949,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/26/2021,"Every morning I have a protein shake with 2TBS of Jot, and it's hard to stop. Man I love this stuff.",5
2950,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/26/2021,"But it’s also about the convenience and presentation. Not only do I get the smoothest coffee I’ve had in years, but there’s less cleanup, more versatility and the sleek apothecary-style bottle is so many vibes.",5

2952,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/26/2021,I have tried repeatedly to make a decent cup of Iced Coffee at home for a couple years now and nothing quite hits the stop. I decided to give Jot a try and followed their recipe perfectly and it is the best!,5
2953,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/26/2021,"Really great taste for such minimal effort. This is perfect for anyone that has to get up way too early to get a proper brew going. After mixing with 8 oz of water, the taste is strong, smooth, and satisfying especially in the Fellow mug which is doing great at keeping things cold and leak-free. Compared to other brands like Javy, Jot is stronger and more complex tasting. 5/5 every time. Customer service is top notch as well. Jot will be my first and only coffee subscription service because I'm so blown away!",5
2954,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/26/2021,"So simple, convenient and potent!",5
2955,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/26/2021,"I usually put peppermint sweet in my coffee, but this one didn't need it. I love the shaker cup... so easy to clean and perfect for frothing😊",5
2956,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/26/2021,"I work a busy job that doesn’t have a decent coffee machine. Jot has been super convenient and makes a delicious coffee product that keeps me caffeinated when I don’t have time to brew a coffee before work. 

Very impressed",5
2957,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/26/2021,This was so good and I was shocked !! Easy and fast to make and I didn’t even need a bunch of creamer !,5

2959,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/26/2021,"I have been craving a good cup of coffee at home for ages! We usually use K-cups, which are always week. Whenever we make a pot, it is always acidic. 
My jot has been delicious and smooth, with a reliable strength every time I make it. I love it!",5
2960,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/26/2021,"So, my first cup was cold; Jot + vanilla unsweetened almond milk + 1 pump Monin French vanilla. HEAVEN. FYI, I am a terrible coffee snob. We have a Breville Oracle Touch, a Mocamaster and love French press. Jot is convenient (because making coffee CAN be fussy, but doesn’t have to be anymore!) and so smoooooth! It makes a delicious affogato heated with water and poured over vanilla gelato. PERFECT in an espresso martini. Yummmmmmm. All of this and the first adorable bottle is still half full! Needless to say, my automatic monthly shipments are set up. :) THANK YOU JOT!",5
2961,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/26/2021,I gave up coffee for a few years because I was sick of buying from shops and using my fancy machines and being underwhelmed. Decided to try this out for my morning iced coffee and it’s soooo good! I use oat milk some days and it gives it a nice nutty flavor. I’m definitely hooked and looking forward to trying to dark out.,5
2962,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/26/2021,"Wow, I was very pleasantly surprised by this coffee! No murky or acrid flavors, just clean coffee.",5
2963,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/26/2021,"Nothing beats waking up and having great tasting iced coffee in seconds. It’s so easy and fun. Messing with proportions between creamer, and water. Finding new ways to easily get great tasting coffee",5
2964,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/26/2021,"I'm a bit of a coffee snob, but decided I'd give this a try since my wife absolutely loves iced-coffee. Gotta say that I'm thoroughly impressed with the simplicity and quality of this stuff. I've even started making specialty drinks that are WAY more cost effective than going to the coffee shop. Just wish they made a decaf version so I can have my coffee drinks all day long without the jitters... but all in all, 5-stars.",5
2965,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/26/2021,Love this new option to get my cold brew coffee in literally 30 seconds. Coffee on the fly....makes for easy time management.,5
2966,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/26/2021,Definitely exceeded my expectation! Loved that jolt of energy after my first cup!,5
2967,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/26/2021,So far I have only used it to make an iced coffee. Adding some sugar and milk. It has a good flavor and mixes very well. I am not sure if its something I would like to use long term as I miss the fresh brewed aspect.,4
2968,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/25/2021,I absolutely love the convenience of having the coffee concentrate. Just a tablespoon and fill the cup with cold milk and away I go. The taste is so crisp and smooth!,5
2969,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/25/2021,I have really enjoyed this and it tastes amazing! I even add it to my protein shakes to create an iced mocha in the morning for breakfast. It is very convenient without sacrificing taste and quality of your normal coffee!,5
2970,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/25/2021,"Tried Jot and am really pleased. I still have a brewed cup of coffee in the morning but JOT is perfect for the mid afternoon pick-me-up. I love how easy it is to create your own coffee drinks. The ability to add more coffee, more flavor, or more milk in my iced lattes is a game changer.",5
2971,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/25/2021,I LOVE coffee. Especially iced coffee. I hate the watering down with the ice after freshly brewing it tho. This is a game changer. I saved money from going out and spending almost 5$ a cup at dunkin or Starbucks and not brewing the perfect cup at home. Just try this. You will not regret it. About to buy my second order.,5
2972,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/25/2021,"This is some of the best coffee I have ever had. I have been drinking it over ice. No cream or sugar necessary! It is so robust and so smooth. It is a real treat, and I tell ever coffee lover I know that they have to try it.",5
2973,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/25/2021,"I mean, what more could you want? I love that you can add less or more liquid based on flavor preference. My favorite drink is a cortado, much because it has less liquid (small bladder folk understand). Get the buzz, without the 17 runs to the bathroom.

It also takes up much less room in the fridge, as compared to cold brew. Such a great option for an office or beverage fridge. 

This will be one of my default holiday gift options for the person that ""has everything"". Pair it with some cute holiday sprinkles and cute cup and everyone will want you to get them for the gift exchange.",5
2974,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/25/2021,I purchased this for my daughter to try to cut down on trips to coffee shops for fancy coffees. She tried it today cold with milk and some caramel syrup and declared it delicious. I did the math— it’s cheaper than 2 weeks of frappe latte grande drinks that smell and taste like burnt beans.,5
2975,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/25/2021,"I've tried this with hot and cold water and milk. It's a very good cup of coffee every time. There's no bitter aftertaste that I've come to expect from a cold brew style of coffee. The price per cup is comparable to something in between at-home french press and a cup at a local café. Overall, it's a great choice for those who prioritize taste or convenience.",5
2976,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/25/2021,I have really enjoyed the coffee I've gotten from Jot. I make an iced coffee every morning to take to work -- it is delicious and has helped me give up my Starbucks addiction. ;) I will certainly be a repeat customer with Jot. My only wish is that it came in decaf too!,5
2977,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/25/2021,I just got my two bottles of Jot last week and have loved every cup of coffee I’ve made! I’ve done iced and hot and they have both been so yummy! Jot makes my morning super convenient when I’m running out of the house. I love it!!!!!,5

2979,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/25/2021,"I was doing pour overs for hot coffee and Stok for cold brew and this coffee easily replaced both. It’s so quick and simple, the taste is nice and smooth, not bitter at all like several concentrates I’ve tried from the grocery store, and I like that I’m not going through a couple plastic bottles per week. It’s also a huge plus that it’s organic.",5
2980,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/25/2021,"Love the convenience of this little bottle of gold. You can have a delicious glass of iced coffee in seconds. It’s smooth, delicious, and oh so easy to prepare.",5

I am very happy I did, it is truly delicious! I bought the bundle with 2 bottles of the original coffee and the cute little mixing tumbler, I love it! This coffee tastes so smooth and yummy, plus it's quick and easy! I just add cold water & ice, cream & vanilla syrup and I am good to go!!! Thank you for great product!! I am in coffee heaven!!!!",5
2983,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/25/2021,I made my coffee this morning and it was amazing!! It was the best cup of iced coffee that I ever had!! It woke me up & gave me energy!!,5

I am an espresso girl all the way so drip coffee just isn't something I enjoy. I have tried all different kinds of cold brews/espressos that are bottled so I can have them whenever without my Nespresso machine. Let me tell you, JOT IS THE WAY TO GO!!!

2994,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/24/2021,What a treat and fantastic gift for the coffee lover! My daughter has tried this from a friend and asked for a subscription as a birthday gift. She has received her first bottle and she is so happy!,5
2995,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/24/2021,Amazing customers service. Free mug came scratched and right away so I was gonna return ro replacement. They've sent another one! Coffee taste potent and good. Use my Review Im not paid for reviews,5
2996,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/24/2021,"I would run out of homemade concentrate and be in a bind for my caffeine fix. It’s nice to have those little bottles in the fridge. It’s tasty, easy, and way less expensive than a Starbucks cold brew every day.",5
2997,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/24/2021,"Yes, the coffee is amazing but most of all it is convenient. Anytime hot or cold no need to brew!!!",5
2998,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/24/2021,"I've only used this for iced coffee, it's summer after all, but I absolutely love it! There's no bitter taste, just a good coffee flavor which I mix a little stronger than the recommended 1 tbs. I like my coffee with just a bit of flavored creamer and jot makes a smooth morning wakeup. I love it!",5
2999,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/24/2021,"Tastes great AND is very convenient. I bought this in hopes of reducing our household iced coffee runs to Starbucks. It seems to be ""working"", and everyone is enjoying it!",5

3001,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/24/2021,"I'm almost done with my first bottle and I can honestly say... this stuff is a game changer. The taste, the smell, the boldness.... everything about it is perfect! So glad I discovered JOT!!!",5
3002,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/24/2021,"I was skeptical. I come from European background and many generations of coffee aficionados. Wasn't sure how this small bottle could contain the flavor of big, bold coffee. I was so surprised! Smooth, no acidity and makes a wonderful cup of coffee, hot and cold. Will buy again.",5
3003,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/24/2021,This coffee tastes so good and it’s so easy to make. I also like that I can personalize it if I need a stronger cup that day. Great if you love good coffee but are always running late like me!,5
3004,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/24/2021,This cold brew is amazing! It tastes great and is easy to pack and take to work for my afternoon pick me up! It is an investment upfront but is cheaper than the alternative when you look at the price per serving.,5
3005,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/24/2021,I’m on my 3rd bottle and still love everything about the product taste and ease of use. However my only concern is the amount of product that goes into the packaging. It seems like a waste of cardboard. There must be a better way. But the Java is to die for.,5
3006,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/24/2021,"I love how simple this was to drink! Pour, pour, stir and drink!! The strength was so surprising and the taste was so good.",5
3007,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/24/2021,"Currently I made a large container of cold brew every 4-5 days with grocery store coffee. This is much easier (obviously), but also much more packaging waste and not quite as good. It's DELICIOUS with milk, and lets you make great iced lattes, but it's also more burnt tasting IMO, so not as good black (how I usually drink my coffee.) I'll keep my Jot bottle around for when I'm lazy or want a latte, but won't switch to it entirely.",4
3008,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/24/2021,"I am so impressed with this coffee, as it is so flavorful with no hint of bitterness. It is a plus at how easy it is to make. I actually look forward to making my coffee instead of buying one. I will continue to order this!",5
3009,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/24/2021,Just wow. I think I'm finally ready to give up my starbucks habit. This is literally the smoothest coffee I have ever had. And so convenient.,5

3012,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/23/2021,I opened my box and immediately made an iced almond milk coffee. I am HOOKED!,5
3013,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/23/2021,"I bought the two-pack bottles, one for home and the other for the office. Very quick and easy to make a quick, delicious tasting cup of coffee. Would definitely recommend!",5
3014,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/23/2021,So far I think it’s great… I haven’t tried it as a “hot” coffee yet but mixed with the cold milk and ice it is very refreshing and tastes good.,5
3015,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/23/2021,Makes a great iced coffee. Shipped quickly. Love the packaging and containers.,5
3016,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/23/2021,"I love Jot. It really has an amazing flavor and can be used so many different ways. I don't have an espresso machine, but this has solved that problem. I love making all kinds of shaken espresso drinks. I make one before I leave the house instead of stopping to buy one. :) Love it.",5
3017,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/23/2021,"This coffee changed my morning routine for work! I have early mornings for my hospital shift, so it’s extremely convenient to not have to brew coffee. It saves me that extra time to sleep more. It tastes delicious in my protein shake, which is a two for one. Highly highly recommend for anyone working.",5
3018,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/23/2021,This is the most delicious iced coffee I've ever had. And it couldn't be quicker and easier to make. Thank you Jot! I love it!!,5
3019,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/23/2021,"I drink my coffee black,.so it was a little on the bitter side but I got used to it very quickly. Jot have a smooth taste compared to other coffee that I tried. I will definitely purchase more in the future.",5
3020,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/23/2021,I mixed my first cup thinking how good can this possibly be?!? I followed directions and added 8 oz oat milk and a bit of honey. I was super surprised!! It tasted just like my everyday morning stop for coffee at a local coffee shop. It is so good and I highly recommend it. I will definitely continue to purchase this.,4
3021,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/23/2021,"I had previously used instant coffee crystals to make my homemade iced coffee, but after trying Jot, I will not be going back! Jot is smoother and dissolves instantly…love it!!!",5
3022,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/23/2021,"Was skeptical, but it is delicious! Packaging has some minor issues that didn’t effect the actual product. When opened it appeared wet so I thought it was leaking (it wasn’t and was still sealed) but all the lettering wiped off when I dried the bottles. 

All in, tastes great and would definitely purchase again and again.",5
3023,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/23/2021,Tastes great with ice and cold water or hot milk. Easy to make and amazing flavor.,5
3024,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/23/2021,"First of all, I am only writing this review because of the promise of $8 off of my next order, so beware of bias. I suspect that this bias is present throughout the reviews. I was not wowed by the taste of the product initially. I definately prefer the taste of drip through my Technivorum. I initially felt that I would cancel my subscription because the taste is good, but inferior. But as I used my two bottles I became more enamored with the product because it is just so damn convenient and the taste is acceptable. I find myself drinking more coffee, however, because I brew in the morning and use the Jot later in the day so my overall coffee costs are going up! So I would say, I would buy it for convenience over taste and remember that convenience always costs extra. For now I will keep the sub, but who knows in the future....",4
3025,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/23/2021,"I was skeptical at first since we are pretty picky when it comes to coffee but, both of us are big fans! We love iced coffee and often have big bottles of cold brew taking up space in our fridge so the small bottle is a winner in my book! Will definitely be buying more when we run out!",5
3026,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/23/2021,"I ordered Jot after seeing someone online review it, and I never imagined it could actually be as good as everyone said. However, just one sip made it feel like my engines were revving and I was ready for the day! I've definitely enjoyed it more cold than hot, but it is never not delicious!",5
3027,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/23/2021,Had my first JOT glass of ice coffee - tasty and super easy! Not going back to driving to a place for my coffee or brewing machines - this is my new normal.,5
3028,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/23/2021,First order. Very convenient for afternoon iced coffee. Only feedback: Would be helpful if the cap were one tbsp so that I didn't need to dirty a spoon. Very good otherwise!,5
3029,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/23/2021,"I was a bit skeptical, but tried anyway. Bought this to use for ice coffee. It was wonderful. Put vanilla creamer in my glass. Added the tbs of coffee and ice. Filled with water. So simple and good. Will be buying more. Quick and easy.",5
3030,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/23/2021,We weren’t sure when we ordered but loved the convenience of it! I have to say I’m highly impressed. It’s so smooth that I can drink it without sugar. We made it all ways imaginable and it’s good in every way!,5
3031,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original (Trial),08/23/2021,"I got this for my wife since she's always drinking coffee. Most premade ready/ concentrate coffees she doesn't like. It's quick, convenient, and less expensive than buying coffee everyday.",5
3032,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/23/2021,"In the morning, I add it to a cup of hot water and in the afternoon, I a drink it to a cup of ice water for a cup of chilled joe! Keeps me going all day. Simply superb flavor and quality.",5
3033,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/23/2021,"I tend to try many types of coffee and the various gadgets to make the best tasting coffee I can make. Sadly, I’ve had some epic failures along the way. 
Ive seen the adds for Jot and thought another coffee and ordered two bottles to take advantage of the free shipping and the free Fellows cup (which I love btw).
I got my order a couple of days ago and tried it right away. OMG, what a surprise! My iced coffee was amazing! So much better then the stuff I had been making before and it saves me so much time. Even my wife who doesn’t drink coffee tried it and gives it two thumbs up. She agreed that it taste better than any of my previous drinks. You got me sold and her too!",5
3034,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/23/2021,"From start to finish, JOT provides a luxury experience that not only includes delicious tasting coffee, but an extremely time-efficient process as well. I would highly recommend JOT to any coffee-lovers.",5

3036,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/23/2021,I was very suspicious at first…a tablespoon for a full cup? Didn’t seem like it could actually be good. I love it! The best part is it’s so easy!,5
3037,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/23/2021,So far so good. Do you have any good recipes,5
3038,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/23/2021,"I drink a lot of coffee. Mostly I’ll grab what’s on sale at the store and go with that. Never been a SB fan but we have some great local coffee shops with really good coffee. However, since I work from home now I don’t really feel like driving down the road a few miles fighting the traffic, lines etc. Then on a whim. I saw Jot in a random add…. Said what rhe heck, and ordered some. Holy cow.bells! This stuff is awesome. Absolutely the best coffee I have ever had. I finished the bottle in 3 days. I’m going to have to work on that:). It really is that good and really convenient. When I make coffee at home I usually end up throwing half the pot out because it’s just “Ok”. This stuff is convenient and no waste. High highly recommend",5
3039,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/23/2021,Jot has been such a lovely experience. Super convenient and quick - which is just what I need on days I am rushing to work! Don’t have time to wait for drip coffee but don’t want to sacrifice the taste. Jot is the way to go!,5
3040,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/23/2021,This is genuinely the best coffee I’ve ever had! The last couple months I’ve been picky about my coffee and I haven’t liked anything I’ve tried - even my usual staples or coffee places. I also love how convenient and quick it is to make each cup of coffee! I can take it on the go anywhere.,5
3041,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/23/2021,I am very pleased with Jot! It makes excellent iced coffee which is my 2 pm fix daily. I Love the pour spout too!,5

3044,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/23/2021,Very impressed with the taste and it’s super convenient,5
3045,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/23/2021,"Was not expecting this coffee to be so good…it blew me away! I made it up as directed, still doubtful, and tasted it very hesitantly. The flavor is rich and bold, smooth yet complex, with no hint of the bitterness I was expecting. Absolutely in love!",5
3046,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/22/2021,Best iced coffee EVER! Enjoyed every last sip of it.,5
3047,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/22/2021,Eric who works in logistics/shipping receiving I believe gave me a bottle to try. It is incredible! I couldn't over hype this product if I tried.,5
3048,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/22/2021,Makes waking up in the morning easier than its ever been takes like 10 seconds to make a cup of coffee that also tastes great and gives me the boost i need. 10/10 would recommend.,5
3049,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/22/2021,It is quick easy and tasty!,5
3050,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/22/2021,"I’m obsessed! I love Jot in my protein shake or in an oatmeal cookie latte. Its so smooth and tasty, plus its so easy!",5
3051,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/22/2021,"I love coffee. I have every device for every kind of coffee, from the Fellow Prisma attachment for my Aeropress to Cold brew and more. I was intrigued by the idea of needing only a teaspoon, but skeptical. 

The coffee itself is excellent. It’s extraordinarily smooth, with great flavor that skews more toward what I get with cold brew than any other brew method. No extra tang or acidic notes, it’s just smooth all around. But, I needed more than a teaspoon to get it to the level of flavor I wanted. I ended up with about two to three teaspoons per 7 ounces water. 

All in all, I’m really happy with my purchase, though I’m not sure if I would pay full price to have it shipped. I got it for a discount and felt that was more where it should be price-wise when compared to other higher-end coffees I buy.

I’d love the option of ordering a much larger bottle. The two smaller bottles will last a while, but when you have two voracious coffee drinkers at home, it goes fast and I don’t want to have to order 2-3 times a month. That said, the smaller bottle will definitely be going with us when we are camping/backpacking. It’s perfect for that (transferred into a non-breakable bottle).",4
3052,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/22/2021,"I love this coffee! I only add some sugar free syrup, ice and water and I’m set for my morning to begin. 10/10 recommend.",5

3056,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/22/2021,I really enjoyed how easy it was to grab a quick cup of cold brew! And it was delicious. I will be a regular customer!,5
3057,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/22/2021,"This stuff is so good. I ordered on a whim from a social media ad. If you love the taste of coffee, you will love this stuff. I bought 2 bottles and made the mistake of sharing them with my grandkids. They fell in love with it, and pretty much wiped out my supply. So easy to make a cup. I prefer making the iced coffee, and now have no need to go to the fancy coffee shops. I feel that Jot is so good, that if you are a coffee fan, you should at least try a bottle.",5
3058,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/22/2021,I start my day with a tablespoon of Jot over toasted coconut almond milk and ice-it is so delicious! I can't imagine starting my day without it:),5

3062,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/22/2021,Little costly for everyday use but when I’m waiting for my cold brew to steep for a day. This is an incredible filler ✅,5
3063,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/22/2021,"I made the jump because I’m sick of paying for iced coffee, and whenever I try to make my own I make it either way too strong or weak and watery. I love that I can just add a tablespoon to a glass and fill with 7 ounces of milk, and recently I tried one spoon with vanilla-flavored ripple and it’s amazing! Not sugary, kind of nutty, smooth and just the right level of caffeine for me. Absolutely love it.",5
3064,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original (Trial),08/22/2021,Became my morning routine drink!,5

3071,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/21/2021,"My husband and I both enjoyed this coffee! It has a slight chocolate caramel flavor. I like adding 8 oz water (I prefer espresso), and my husband likes to add 12 oz. water (he is more of a cold brew guy).",5

3079,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/21/2021,"I heated my 16oz of almond milk, added a tbsp and a half of Jot and drove on to work. I was quite happy with the energy it provided without jitteriness (2 tbsp... shew!!)

The flavor is perfect. Many concentrated coffees bring a burnt taste with them... not Jot... just like a coffee shop fresh pressed cup! Sent my 2nd bottle with my daughter to college. (Wish I didn't... want it all for myself...lol)",5

3083,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/21/2021,I had stopped drinking coffee for over a year. The stress and struggle of going to Starbucks or making the perfect cold brew at home was too much.

For coffee lovers that enjoy the rich taste of things like Vietnamese iced coffee or new-orleans style cold brew, this will blow your mind. Notes of chicory and roasted nuts are plentiful, and notable caffeine content is present. Incredibly, just one tablespoon and your favorite cream now does the job.

3089,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/21/2021,I’ve been looking for a way to make iced coffee from home. The Keurig button for iced coffee is always too watered down. I love Jot for iced lattes! Problem solved.,4

3092,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/21/2021,"I was a bit skeptical on whether I’d really like this coffee or not, but I figured it was a quick and easy option worth giving a try. I’m so glad I did! I find myself reaching for jot even if there’s a full pot of brewed coffee available. Such a nice smooth flavor, and so easy to make lattes, iced coffee, or blended ice coffees with it. Will for sure be buying again.",5
3093,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/21/2021,"Like most, I was hesitant to try something that I saw on a social media advertisement, but my wife and I are both stoked that we did. This stuff is amazing and amazingly simple, it is seriously and every day ****** for me.",5

So happy with my purchase!",5
3096,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/21/2021,I’m very satisfied with Jot! I think I drink way too much of it. I mostly drink it cold but also tried it hot like espresso and really enjoyed that too! Thank you for a great product!!,5
3097,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/21/2021,"I was house sitting for my daughter and she left me my first bottle of Jot! It came with a tablespoon in a velvet bag and a cool glass! I really enjoyed it. I’m a newish coffee drinker and really prefer it cold, and Jot is so delicious cold!!! I recently ordered two more bottles and they came with these great insulated cups! I thank you for the yummy beverage and my daughter for introducing me to Jot! 😍",5
3098,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/21/2021,"I travel a lot for work and I often work inconsistent/odd hours. Getting coffee on the way or brewing hotel coffee isn't always ideal or possible so Jot seemed perfect. I prefer a very bold bitter cup of coffee and Jot is good, but tends to get a little sour when I attempt to add a little extra. I find myself using it to enhance my morning coffee instead of replacing it altogether. The bottles are small and the tablespoon per 8oz is not enough for me, but it has been AWESOME to travel with.",4
3099,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/21/2021,"Such great flavor. For someone on the go, this is so perfect every morning. I either froth some milk to make an espresso style drink or make an iced drink. The quality is so good. Can’t find something like this in stores. Very happy to have found this!",5
3100,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/21/2021,"I have had my first bottle for about a week now and I have to resist the urge to make more than 1 cup a day. I absolutely love this coffee and it is by far the best tasting coffee I have ever had. 
I love that it is quick and easy to prepare AND this does not affect the quality and overall taste of the product.",5

3105,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/21/2021,I was skeptical when reviewing this coffee and deciding if I wanted to try it. I am super cheap and NEVER get iced coffee from the coffee shops because I have goals. I love iced coffee though! I decided to give Jot a try and I’m glad I did! I get to have iced coffee that tastes delicious right from my kitchen for a fraction of the price! Good stuff!,5
3106,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/21/2021,"This is delicious, and so easy to make. Love love love",5
3107,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/20/2021,"Ordered with high hopes after reading the reviews, and was not disappointed! One tablespoon and a splash of cream makes for a super smooth iced coffee. Have recommended to several co-workers who asked where I got my mug from (I ordered the Jot-Fellow promo). Love it - about to order another 2 bottles!",5

3109,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/20/2021,"This process is so simple and I love it! Makes it so easy to prepare the night before. When I get to work, I just add ice. 

The coffee taste is kind of bitter. I don't add any milk, as I prefer my coffee black. Even though, its bitter, I think it is growing on me.

I hope they will be able to offer a variety of coffee styles/flavors in the future. 

Overall, I recommend trying this!",4

3111,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/20/2021,"This is really great to make my fave coffee drink - mocha chocolate milk, ha ha. I use half a tablespoon and that's the perfect amount, and it saves me even more money on buying ""outside"" coffee.",5

3113,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/20/2021,"When I had my first cup of Jot I was surprised at the taste and ease of use. Having a very busy life filled with school work children and a home to care for I often have several coffees a day. That comes with much extra work, brewing coffee , going to the store when you run out , descaling the machine, doing the dishes. Now I take out a spoon and a cup and my coffee is ready. Thanks for the free delivery and all the free time I now have",5

3117,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/19/2021,"I bought Jot for the convenience and it definitely is convenient, but I’m unsure if the price is worth the convenience. It’s cheaper for me to make drip coffee and drink more coffee to get the caffeine…",3
3118,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/19/2021,It tastes ok. This is better for someone who wants to make many complicated coffee drink recipes. I’ve had better pre made coffee from cans.,3
3119,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original (Trial),08/19/2021,"My first cup…after all we’ve been through this last year getting a customized cup of coffee was impossible, for me it did not happen at all. Jot changed this. Now I customize my daily coffee without lines and others temperament. Smooth, rich, with depth and flavorful each time. Will order ASAP! And the customer service just as good.",5
3120,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/19/2021,"I have a coffee bar with everything from carafe to espresso so it’s safe to say I’m a huge coffee fan.

3122,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/19/2021,I ordered this coffee because I was noticing how much money I was spending at the coffee houses for iced coffee every morning. Decided to give this one a try and I gotta say it’s actually pretty. Been drinking it for a week now and I think I’m a convert. Never again am I buying iced coffee at those coffee shops ever. I will continue buying this coffee because it’s pretty good.,5
3123,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/19/2021,Easy to make and delicious too!,5
3124,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/19/2021,"I’m a bit of a coffee snob. I like using a high end espresso in my aero press in the winter, and a strong cold brew in the summer. Jot fills both these requirements with a smooth, non-bitter concentrate that makes coffee prep almost instant. I love the stuff!",5
3125,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/19/2021,"Tastes great, not bitter, easy to mix and super convenient. I do wish the shipping was faster but that’s my only complaint.",5
3126,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/19/2021,"After reading several reviews, I pulled the trigger on a two bottle subscription. Delicious! Both my wife and I have become addicted. So easy to prepare hot or cold daily coffee or a decadent weekend latte. Awesome product!
Now I gotta try the new dark roast. I can’t wait!",5
3127,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/19/2021,I love coffee but I never make time to make some but with this I don’t have to wait for water to boil or scoop grinds and wait. I just grab milk and a tablespoon and I’m ready for the day!,5
3128,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/19/2021,"Jot is the perfect solution for quick, quality coffee! So far, I’ve only had it iced due to the summer weather, but I’m looking forward to trying it hot later this year. I have already recommended Jot to a number of friends and family members and would encourage anyone who loves coffee to try it!",5
3129,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/19/2021,I have tried a number of concentrates and made my own. This is by far the easiest way to start the morning right! Would definitely recommend,5

3135,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/19/2021,I was very excited to try Jot! I procrastinated trying to decide if I would try it... I mean how good could it be.. well... It *** better than expected.. so good my daughter and I are anxiously awaiting our next shipment !!,5
3136,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/19/2021,"I like this coffee because you can make it as strong or weak as people like it. I also use this in my baking (chocolate cakes and brownies).

3137,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/19/2021,"We love our Chemex and our whole bean coffee, but some mornings we need quicker coffee and Jot… boy is it quick and easy. But not just that, it's really good coffee!",5

3139,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/19/2021,"I ordered Jot as I was looking for an easy way to make iced coffee in the summer. And the cute tumbler may have solidified the purchase :). I LOVE the taste of the coffee both mixed with water and plant based milks. I will still purchase local beans, buy this adds to the diversity of my coffee options!",5
3140,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/18/2021,"I was very skeptical at first but anything that can save me some time in the morning prep to work I was willing to try.

This makes it so convenient to just pour my choice of liquid and voila! My coffee is ready to go!

Now I no longer have to remember to make my cold brew the night before, no more cleaning my coffee makers and have so much less waste as well.",5

3142,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/18/2021,I tried another product similar to Jot not too long ago. Needless to say it did not live up to its hype and tasted like dirt. I took a chance on Jot and loved it so much I subscribed. I'm hooked.,5
3143,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/18/2021,I’m loving how easy it is to make iced coffee at home. It’s so good and refreshing during the hot summer. Can’t wait to try it hot as the weather cools off!,5
3144,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/18/2021,"I was nervous to try at first because I read a few reviews that said it was weak. I’m glad I tried it anyway! The coffee is sooooo god, and super quick to make! It is life changing in the office too (now that I have to go back)",5
3145,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/18/2021,"No complaints! I like that they put how much caffeine is in one tbsp. I'm no coffee expert, but it tastes just fine to me, and you can't beat the convenience. I like the glass bottle as well. Good and eco-friendly. About to place my second order.",5
3146,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/18/2021,"My bottle was pretty good, and I liked how fast I could make iced coffee in the morning. Coffee was always just a tad watery, but that may be more on my proportions than the product.",4

3149,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/18/2021,"Better than javy, which I think has a nutty flavor, Jot is smooth without being weak. Also it pours without dripping because the bottle is designed better than javy. It gets only 4 stars because of the higher price.",4
3150,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/18/2021,Love this stuff. No bitterness and very smooth. Followed the instructions and can drink it black over ice with no issue. Taste great with milk/cream also. Love the options to customize and make several different ways.,5

3153,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/18/2021,"Was skeptical but oh my, it is super tasty and easy to make. I do not think I can go back to my old ways to make coffee anymore.",5
3154,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/18/2021,"The concept intrigued me, of using only 1 Tbsp to make a cup of coffee, but I became an instant fan with my first cup. The taste is phenomenal! I usually dose my coffee liberally with creamer, but with JOT I only add water or milk. No acidic after taste, no jitters, and I'm satisfied with only one or two 12 oz cups! That's amazing because I am known for my 3 or 4 mochas or lattes per day habit.... which adds up FAST! JOT is super portable, I loved the Fellow cup that came with it, and it's so much cheaper than buying all those coffee stand drinks! I am a serious fan for life!",5
3155,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/18/2021,"I’m the person who usually grinds their own beans, and uses a French press or a nice pour over. Jot isn’t either of those.

3156,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/17/2021,I say treat yourself because at the current price per cup it is a treat. As someone who drinks coffee alone and doesn't always have time for a pour over it is nice to have JOT on hand. I drink mine over ice with a tablespoon of vanilla syrup or Irish cream syrup currently and love it. Maybe they will continue to expand their line in the future to have different flavor profiles like chicory or specific blends as I use JOT to replace my Starbucks visits.,4
3157,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/17/2021,Taste great and convenient to prepare in a variety of fashions,5
3158,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/17/2021,"My first impression was that if it tasted half as good as it was presented I had no worries. The bottle came beautifully packaged that i didn't really want to disturb its presentation. I am glad I did as my first cup was perfectly strong and milky; No fuss, I only had to boil the kettle. .I will definitely purchase again.",5
3159,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/17/2021,"Very impressed with this product. The concentrate makes for a great iced coffee that is flavorful and without any of bitterness of many other iced coffees. A great, convenient option for summer mornings.",5

3164,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/17/2021,"I tried my first cup yesterday, and wow, was surprised at the bold and smooth flavor with such a small portion of coffee! I travel quite a bit and will definitely bring this with me on the road, the hotel room coffee is too weak for me! I also tried with a splash of half/half, another excellent combo. I did not prefer adding ice as it weakened the flavor.",5

3167,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/17/2021,Ultra coffee is a great way to get that jump start on your morning. I'm a huge fan of mochas with extra espresso.

3172,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original (Trial),08/17/2021,"So I drink coffee everyday.. I have to say this is a great product., this code is pure and yummy .. a little goes along way thank you",5
3173,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/17/2021,"I love how Jot is so convenient! I like the chocolate/caramel profile and that it is very concentrated so it lasts longer than a cold brew concentrate that I usually make. Overall, great branding and packaging. Would really love if Jot had a fruity/acidic cold brew concentrate. That would probably make me reorder more regularly.",4
3174,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/17/2021,"Working remotely during the pandemic, one of my social isolation pleasures was having a cup of coffee brewed in my newly upgraded Keurig. The downside was having to wait for my coffee to cool to a temperature I enjoyed drinking. Since trying Jot my Keurig has grown dusty and lonely!

I bought the bundle of 2 bottles of Jot with a free 12oz tumbler and added the measuring spoon to my order and this has been one of my best mail order purchases in a while. Using the tumbler, I add 2 ice cubes, one measuring spoon of Jot Concentrate, and 2 to 3 spoons of creamer along with cold water. I screw on the lid to the tumbler and vigorously shake for a foamy, refreshing iced coffee. Now that I'm headed back into the office, I'm looking forward to this quick alternative to brewing a morning coffee.",5
3175,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/17/2021,"I like the convenience. The flavor is fine, but not special enough to justify the price. If it was cheaper than it could have the possibility of becoming a pantry staple. Love the glass bottles and the promo with the free fellow mug was what got me to actually buy after watching the ads for awhile.",4
3176,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/17/2021,I would consider myself quite picky when it comes to coffee. This is by far one of the smoothest coffee I've tried. It's quick and easy for your daily cup and amazing for cocktails.,5

Initially bought it on a whim just to try something new, but I’m so glad I did and I can definitely see this becoming part of my daily routine! I’m usually an espresso drinker because I like it a little more concentrated and a little more flavorful, and you have so much flexibility with this product to get exactly what you want that it’s been perfect for me!",5

I am a coffee addict so I am picky about my coffee. But damn, I was hooked on first sip. For once, advertisement doesn’t lie about how good this coffee is. It is very smooth for concentrated coffee with a hint of nutty flavor. The coffee smells amazing. 
Safe to say, I will be Jot’s loyal customer.",5
3179,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/17/2021,This ultra Jot coffee not only taste amazing but is one of the smoothest coffees I have ever tasted. All I did was add 1 tbsp to 9 oz of water boom!

I’ve been a coffee lover since forever however my Stomach rejects it , especially when I have just black coffee . I’ve had everything under the sun from the best coffee that claim to be non acidic to the cappuccinos and craft stuff . I can have the ladder it’s the espressos that get me and I am so glad I am able to enjoy a cup of joe without the side effects. Everything from the aroma to the taste is a delight !

3183,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/17/2021,"It has excellent flavor, I just wish there was a lower acid option.",4
3184,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/17/2021,My first week was wonderful. The taste was awesome and I do have an opinion on this product yet.,5
3185,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/17/2021,"Regular coffee flavor. No bitterness. The concentrated fluid method makes it exceptionally easy to prepare, and to flavor for changing tastes. Additionally, my regularly irritable stomach didn’t react adversely to this product. 

My order was initially incomplete, but customer service was a breeze, they fixed it quickly and kindly.",5
3186,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/16/2021,Love this coffee! It smells like chocolate to me and is nice and rich. Also can’t beat the convenience of pouring and going.,5
3187,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/16/2021,"The coffee has a wonderful smell and also tastes great. It is a little bit more acidic than I like compared to how I make my espressos, but I know sometimes other people (and myself on occasion) enjoy a little more acidity in a coffee as well.",5
3188,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/16/2021,"I am a cold brew lover. This is a simple, economical way for me to enjoy my cold brew. It is smooth and delicious. I promise I will try it hot someday. I would love to keep a bottle (well hidden) in the office fridge, once that happens. Yummy coffee anytime.",5
3189,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/16/2021,My husband who doesn't even like coffee loves the flavor! Will definitely order more.,5
3190,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/16/2021,Jot is so convenient and delicious. I love how it is small and compact in my fridge and it tastes great.,5
3191,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/16/2021,"I was getting the Starbucks Double Shot espressos, but gave Jot a try. Saves money and trash as I add this and water to my tumbler in the morning before leaving for work. One extra step aside from grabbing a can of coffee, but honestly it's worth it!",5
3192,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/16/2021,"I love how simple this is! And it’s really good, the coffee is smooth. It’s easy to customize, just add more if you like stronger coffee. The empty glass jars are great for propagating plants too!",5
3193,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/16/2021,I was previously buying cold brew growlers from the coffee shop down the street. Jot is cheaper and better. So happy to have coffee anytime.,5
3194,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/16/2021,"I put off ordering Jot because it seemed like such a crazy idea and was expecting the coffee to taste much like instant coffee - bitter, flavorless, and undrinkable. I WAS WRONG. Jot exceeded my expectations and broke the glass ceiling!! It’s ridiculously smooth, creamy, and has beat my favorite fancy coffee order from my favorite shop. Well done.",5
3195,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/16/2021,"I was a bit skeptic at first, but am now a believer! It tastes amazing with hot or cold water. I gave some bottles to friends and they jumped on the bandwagon as well.",5
3196,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/16/2021,"I always take coffee to work. I’ve tried kcups (wasteful) and brewed my own (prep, hassle, cleaning) became tiring. 

Then I found Jot and it’s been a game changer. I no longer have to plan ahead whether I hot hot or cold. Saves me a ton of time as well.",5
3197,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/16/2021,"I am a discerning coffee connoisseur. So I was nervous to try this, but have been looking for a more instant coffee for quick mornings and camping. This is it! the flavor is great and has a that potent caffeine kick!",5
3198,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/16/2021,"I love iced lattes all year-round, but homemade iced coffee never tasted quite right. Tried Jot to see if it would curb my need to go out and buy expensive cafe drinks - and it did! The coffee concentrate tasted weaker than I had anticipated, but I really like bold lattes so I've been figuring out the perfect ratio for my taste portfolio. A single bottle lasts a lot longer than I thought it would, too! Jot is a great replacement for expensive cafe drinks and not-quite-right homemade brews!",4
3199,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/16/2021,"Get up and go juice? Shot of life? Either way, this stuff will rock your socks and tastes great!",5

3203,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/16/2021,"I love this coffee! I'm always running late for my first meeting in the morning. Now with Jot, I can heat water, while I get my cream and sugar, then add Jot, and the water is done. Amazing coffee in less then 3 minutes, and now plastic pod waste!!",5
3204,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/16/2021,"Thank you Andrew (Drew?), appreciate your reaching out.

We wanted to be sure we tried out several different ways, before responding. It’s an adjustment to how simple it is, pleasantly surprising how wonderful it tastes and truly matches up to its promise, to be ‘the best”!
So far, enjoyed Hot, iced, drizzled over ice cream and added with Kahlúa to make an awesome Sombrero as well as a coffee-tini (martini)!
We give it multiple thumbs up.

Saw an ad the other day for a ‘coming soon’ to a stronger, bolder new something!, but then lost it, so will look forward to see what comes out!

Thanks, Chris",5
3205,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/16/2021,"I have not have this long and have only tried it iced but so far I love it. I was making my own iced “lattes” with coffee pot coffee and it just wasn’t giving me the taste that the big chain coffee shops gave, so I decided to try Jot. It has a great taste and is SO easy to make. I can’t wait to try it hot once the weather cools off. I have already ordered another bottle.",5
3206,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/16/2021,Fast an amazing,5
3207,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/16/2021,"I have been a caffeine addict since college, and I frequent Starbucks almost daily (sometimes making multiple trips a day) to get my fix. I gave Jot a chance after coming across it on Instagram, and wasn’t sure what exactly to expect. But I can say that I was pleasantly surprised by what I got. So to make a good cup of Jot, you really just need to add some water, which is what I did for my husband, essentially making a cold brew, while I made myself a latte, adding in a vanilla almond milk. My husband couldn’t stop commenting that it was better than the cold brew he would normally get from Starbucks, enjoying the quick and easy steps, and just beautiful, smooth flavors that came through, without jeopardizing the caffeine aspect of it. For myself, I similarly enjoyed my cup of Jot, never realizing how foundational this product could be for my mornings, especially during busy weeks ahead. Thank you Jot, for making such a phenomenal coffee concentrate that adapts to the busy schedules of my husband and myself and essentially saves us money and less trips to Starbs.",5
3208,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/16/2021,"I love Jot!! I live off of caffeine and don’t have much time for myself so I love that having a cup of Jot requires minimal prep but there’s so many ways to drink it! We have used regular milk, oat milk, and with vanilla sweetener. The coffee is strong enough to give you the energy just doesn’t have a strong bitter taste so you really don’t even need sweetener. I’m def going to be subscribing!",5
3209,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/16/2021,"I really love the coffee it's so easy. 
I only wish they came in flavors",5
3210,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/16/2021,"love the taste - i've tried a lot of packaged up coffee similar to jot, but this one definitely is the smoothest & least bitter. only downside is that they say it makes 14 cups but i like a little more than just 8 oz of coffee per cup so it's gonna last me less than 14 days, which is a little pricey. still great though",4
3211,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/16/2021,"Although it is on the pricier side, it is worth every single penny. Do not wait, try it and you will not be disappointed! I have already ordered my second 2 pack",5
3212,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/16/2021,"Incredible coffee! The mug is even more incredible! The ice lasted ALL day long! And it was left out of the fridge! Each time I went for a sip, it was as cold as it was in the morning! 👌&#55356;The coffee is amazing! It really keeps me up and going throughout my work shift! So happy!!",5
3213,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/16/2021,"Love everything about this product. Tastes great, super convenient, and saving me money big time. Would recommend this to any coffee lover.",5
3214,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/16/2021,"I decided to give this a shot since I haven’t been able to find the Stumpyown cold brew concentrate I usually use. I’ve been saying for over a year that I wish Stumptown did a subscription service, milk man style, where they’d deliver and take the empty bottles back. It was cool to find that someone is doing something similar, although I do wish I could give back the empties along with the packaging. While I love that there’s no glue in the box, it’s still a lot of cardboard. The flavor is not as acidic as Stumptown cold brew, and in my opinion tastes a little flat in comparison. I’m kind of on the fence about a subscription still…it’s almost exactly what I’m looking for but not quite there. We’ll see if the flavor grows on me.",4
3215,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/16/2021,I add this to my protein shake (huel) before and after working out . Very smooth and robust but really too expensive- might have to cut down on my cable :),4
3216,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/16/2021,"Made my first cup on ice with a dash of sweetener. 
The smooth rich flavor was better than I expected. I knew after that first cup, I'd be a life long drinker of Jot!",5
3217,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/16/2021,I’ve only had it iced so far and it quite nice. I like how quick it is for an afternoon pick me up. And the caffeine is legit.,4
3218,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/16/2021,I’ve traveled all over the world & this is one of the most amazing coffees I have ever had! 100% great taste & the cup makes it easy to make for “on the go”!,5

3222,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original (Trial),08/15/2021,"Love this ultra coffee! It's so easy to make either a hot or cold cup, and I love the absence of plastic.",5
3223,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/15/2021,"I thought I was getting 2 coffees and the double-walled glasses. But instead, I received 1 coffee and the wrong set of glasses. New glasses on the way.
Prompt customer service, but still feel kinda gypped on the coffee.",5
3224,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/15/2021,"I was surprised! Its really good...strong, flavorful, yet not at all bitter!",5
3225,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/15/2021,I was a little skeptical at first when I had my first taste because I didn’t get that initial smack in the face with coffee feeling the way I do with my normal Vietnamese coffee but after playing with the coffee mixture a bit I got it just right with Jot! It’s delicious and the insulated on the go mug I got with it makes me a happy camper when I’m drinking from it.,5
3226,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/15/2021,Jot is great for quickly putting together a perfect iced delicious iced latte before heading out the door for work.,5
3227,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/15/2021,"This makes a wonderful cup! I’ve enjoyed it with almond milk and sweetener and also black (always cold). My only challenge is the price. I tend to drink a lot of coffee throughout the day and the cost is prohibitive to that qty. but I’m also attempting to cut that back. I’ve been enjoying one 8oz serving of Jot a day and have not yet emptied the first bottle in a weeks time. I use it as an afternoon treat and drink my other cold brew in morning. 
Was very surprised and delighted at the taste! Ive shared it with two coworkers and both have gone on to purchase Jot as well! So yay for that!! Thanks! I will continue to enjoy as my afternoon pick me up treat!!",4

3232,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/15/2021,"Finally an easy, fast great tasting coffee. My favorite has been with milk to make a great latte.",5
3233,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/15/2021,"So initially when I brewed up my first few cups of this I was excited because for the first few sips while it was nice and hot the taste was pretty good. Then, as the cups cooled down a little the concentration seemed to have some strange separation and buildup on the edges of the cup. Also, as it cooled the taste became almost molasses like. It wasn’t like it had even cooled that much either, just as any normal cup of coffee would in the morning. Lastly, i was pretty disappointed with the packaging and the amount of waste. Did you need to use that much cardboard? It’s not like you were shipping two bottles of uranium… Oh, and the last last thing is the price. While I was convinced to buy these with the free Fellow mug I still can’t understand why this stuff is double the price per ounce of brewed coffee then a single origin whole bean bag of coffee.",3
3234,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/15/2021,"Nice taste, both hot or iced. A little overpriced though…",4
3235,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/15/2021,Tastes great. Makes my mornings run smoothly! No more stops at the coffee shops,5

3238,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/15/2021,"I decided to try this in effort to simplify my morning cup of coffee. I’ve been pleasantly surprised by how satisfying the coffee is. It’s much stronger than expected, and a tablespoon with water and ice and oatmilk checks my iced coffee needs better than a $5 cup at a coffee shop. 😍",5
3239,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/15/2021,I really enjoy this coffe and the combo with the fellow mug. Super cute,5
3240,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/15/2021,"I love not, it tastes delicious and I also love how quick and easy I can make ice coffee now.

A great gift for a wide range of addicts! I waited to try Jot with my best coffee pal. We went plain the first time out, plain oat milk, no flavors or sweeteners. We thought it was good! Borderline delicious actually. We expected the coffee to have a bitter, burnt sour taste, or be too strong. Nope. We really liked it and it was a fun experiment. Per day, my friend drinks iced lattes w/ 3 or 4 shots in them. I drink one or two cups drip coffee. We both thought one hit of Jot was enough, she did not want more later in the day, and neither of us felt jittery. Well done Tony Hawk and friends.",5

3287,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/14/2021,"This is the first coffee concentrate I've tasted that actually tastes like a decent cup of coffee. I prefer it cold, but I've tried it hot also. I still like to make a cup of coffee the old way at times, but this has been a great option on those busy mornings.",5

3289,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/14/2021,Hi! I loved the concentrate! I’ve been trying to find an alternative to buying iced coffee every morning and after 18 months and a LOT of money spent I think I might’ve found something I like more than my morning place. I wish it came with the recipe book for all of the other things on Instagram! Testing out espresso martinis today,5
3290,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/14/2021,"Flavor is really good, love the compactness of the bottles, just seems like it goes too quickly and the cost is adding up quickly.",4

3295,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/14/2021,Was skeptical because I’ve never tried anything like this but it’s the best at home coffee I’ve ever had. Addicted from first sip. It’s so smooth & rich .. I can’t believe how good it is,5
3296,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/14/2021,I love this stuff. Rich deep flavor but zero bitterness. I need this in travel packets!!!,5

3302,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/14/2021,"As my title states, I am usually a tea drinker. Coffee occasionally. My daughter told me about Jot and I bought 2 bottles. I love it! I make mine as an iced latte. Unsweetened vanilla almond milk, Jot and a splash of unsweetened vanilla coffee flavoring over ice. Perfect! I still drink tea, but I find myself reaching for Jot most mornings.",5
3303,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/14/2021,"Jot is the cold (as I have not tried it hot yet) coffee answer I have been looking for. I love keeping a bottle at work so if I want a second cup, or an afternoon pick me up, it’s right there. And I also love that there’s minimal waste due to their glass packaging.",5
3304,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/14/2021,Nice alternative for having great coffee for work! I can just stick it in the fridge and I am able to have delicious coffee anytime!,5

Created yummy coffee for simple people who don’t want to go out and drive to a coffee place 

I own many devices to make my own coffee at home. You have given me and my husband an option for the days we are busy and don’t have time to set up drip or grind coffee beans 

The taste is rich and smooth. No matter iced, hot, flavored. You can create the perfect coffee with JOT!! Will be ordering more and gifting as well 

Thank you for an amazing addition to coffee",5
3320,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/14/2021,Jot is great tasting and super quick for an awesome coffee any time and any where!,5
3321,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/14/2021,"I love the idea behind this coffee concentrate! I will love the coffee when I get just the right amount added to the hot water (I'm sure of it!); a smidge too little, and it's insipid, and just a little too much reminds me that although it does not taste particularly dark, there certainly is caffeine in it!
Thanks; I'll keep trying. :)",5
3322,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/14/2021,I have been making the best dairy free iced coffee for myself. The flavor is great and doesn’t upset my stomach or leave that fake metallic taste I’ve had with instant coffee powders.,5
3323,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/14/2021,There was a shipping issue with my initial order but customer service was very helpful and got it sorted out. I’m officially a fan of jot!,5

3328,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/14/2021,"We love it. My husband, son, and I are all sold. I like the convenience for sure, but the taste is what really did for everyone.",5
3329,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/14/2021,I work full time during the week and part time over night on weekends. I started bringing Jot with me on the weekend as I can’t get away from a desk to make coffee but I do have a fridge and freezer. What a game changer. It’s smoothe and great with water or milk. I drink mine black and don’t get an acid stomach ache. 10/10 will recommend to friends and even buy sets as gifts for the coffee lovers in my family.,5
3330,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/14/2021,"Usually concentrated coffees are either very acidic or bitter. For example, even the dark roast coffee concentrate or cold brew concentrates from Trader Joe’s have those issues. Jot is extremely smooth without any bitterness or unpleasant acidity.",5

3332,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/14/2021,I made my first cup in the Fellow thermos with ice and almond milk. It was a very happy cup of coffee. I let my husband have a sip and he thought it was great too. I look forward to my cup of iced jot everyday now. I’m so glad I tried it.,5

3334,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/14/2021,I took a chance on Jot thinking it would be more of the same old hype. I was wrong. It's the best coffee I've ever had. The flavor is intense without tasting overbrewed. Congratulations,5

3338,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/13/2021,I was most pleasantly surprised at the depth of flavor and smoothness. I look forward to trying it over ice!,5
3339,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/13/2021,I love it! I’m a coffee snob and I was surprised that I liked it! Normally I don’t! It’s so easy to make and so so yummy!!! I use Oat Milk because dairy isn’t my friend! And it gives it a great taste! But my husband had it with regular milk and loved it as well!,5
3340,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/13/2021,Addictive! It has a smooth taste and is my go-to for cold coffee! Will definitely be ordering again and I have told all my friends and family about it!,5

I was really just buying the coffee to get the ceramic coated mug. It is so good! Absolutely no bitterness, almost a little sweet. I will definitely be buying more! Thx guys!!",5
3344,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/13/2021,"Smooth, full flavor and so so easy to concoct one’s own magical beverage. Very yummy",5

3347,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/13/2021,It’s a good quick cup of iced coffee. I haven’t tried it hot yet. I wouldn’t say it’s spectacular it is more middle of the road. I will buy again though because it is a lot more convenient then any other way.,3

I’ve been drinking it iced. with some flavored creamer and a splash of half and half, perfection! The boost of energy I get is the best! You guys knocked it put of the park! Waaaaay better than coffee I brew in the coffee maker, no kidding! TRY.IT!!!!’",5

3351,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/13/2021,"It’s gotten so hard to find a good iced coffee, I took a leap and ordered jot. Best decision of the summer! Only problem is I want to drink it all day long!!!",5
3352,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/13/2021,Was pleasantly surprised how rich and flavorful the first cup was with using just a tablespoon and milk and instant latte!,5
3353,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/13/2021,"I was skeptical this would be strong enough to ""work"" as advertised, but this is a brilliant idea and really good coffee. This is the most cost-, time-, and space-efficient way to make iced coffee I've ever found (that still lets you make it how you like it) - and it's GOOD. We love iced coffee, but we've struggled to get it strong enough (without a fancy machine), and NEVER made it well in a hurry. This is an awesome solution we love; we'll be regular buyers.",5
3354,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/13/2021,"My 1st cup of Jot coffee was like heaven to my taste buds. I was really quite surprised. Now, every morning I have my two glasses of Jot with milk and ice. The best flavor ever. I’m so glad I decided to try it.",5
3355,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/13/2021,I've been looking for a product that is an easy solution to be a replacement for the single use coffee pods. I love how you can make it either hot or cold as well as how strong you would like it. This makes a smooth cup of coffee that is not bitter. I look forward to my next cup tomorrow.,5
3356,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/13/2021,"I was excited for my husband to try this as a time-saver on his way to work. Unfortunately, he found it to lack flavor (and he takes his iced coffee black). Sadly, we won’t be ordering again.",3
3357,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/13/2021,"8 oz. low-fat milk, ice, a squirt of vanilla syrup, and a tablespoon of Jot. Lovely 🥰",5

3360,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/13/2021,So easy to make iced coffee. Will be purchasing again.,5
3361,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/13/2021,I typically drink tea because I have to add to many things to coffee when I drink it. I heard good things about Jot and decided to try it and drink it iced. I love Jot. It is smooth and flavorful.,5
3362,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/13/2021,"Good flavor and can mix with almost anything. It’s quick and easy. One thing I noticed when mixing with coke it has a reaction and foams up. Other than that, it’s super simple and easy.",5
3363,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/13/2021,"Not that I'm lazy (okay maybe a little) but when I want a glass of iced coffee I don't always feel like getting in my car and waiting in line outside of a coffee shop, wearing my mask in the summer heat. Sure, sometimes I'll pour some of my brewed coffee over ice, but Jot removes even that small amount of work, making it super easy to have on a whim. The Jot coffee is also very high quality with a complex flavor that avoids the bitterness so often present in ""high end"" coffees. Jot is definitely a winner in my book.",5
3364,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/13/2021,I couldn’t believe it when I tasted my first cup of Joy. So smooth and no bitterness. And easy!,5
3365,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/13/2021,"I’m always weary of cold brew concentrates not tasting strong enough at the recommended “dosage” but Jot does not disappoint! As someone who usually downs three cups of strong black coffee daily, I’ve been happily enjoying Jot with a little cream and sugar over ice and water without any sign of watered down taste. I’m definitely into this.",5
3366,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/13/2021,This coffee is tasty! Smooth. Not bitter at all. I seriously could drink all 14 cups (1 bottle) in two days. I work nights as a nurse and love my coffee. It is a little pricey compared to brewing at home though. 😞,4
3367,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/13/2021,"I am a bit of a coffee freak, and after having my second baby I quickly became a Starbuck every day gal due to the ease of order and pick up. I do have a nespresso machine, and a stovetop espresso maker, but struggle to find the few minutes to make my drink at home.

I was unsure of JOT, but a week in to it and I haven't visited Starbucks once this week. JOT has excellent flavor and all the needed caffeine to get this sleep deprived mama through her 40 hour work week!! So happy I found JOT. . . and so is my wallet!! :)",5
3368,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/13/2021,"I love what Jot has done to enhance my morning routine via my daily coffee! I shake it up with oat milk, brown sugar, and ice, and it is my new favorite drink. I am so happy I tried it out and will definitely be ordering again.",5

3375,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/13/2021,I’m really loving Jot coffee for iced coffee. The only negative is I need 2tbs for a really good iced coffee otherwise I just taste weak coffee. That’s my only complaint…that I’m going through the bottle faster than I’d planned! 😂,3

3380,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/13/2021,"I'll be honest... I bought in because of some sleek marketing and figured I'd give it a shot for my afternoon coffee as a worst case. Blown away with the smooth, rich flavor of what Jot packs into each cup. They've got a lifer out of me after the first sip!",5
3381,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/13/2021,My husband and I really enjoyed the taste and convenience of Jot coffee. It was so easy to make a cold/hot coffee in the morning. I loved the recycle-able packaging as well. Two thumbs up!,5

3383,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/13/2021,"I would never have thought I could get something better than coffee house coffee at home, without machines, space, or mess. I knew the second I popped the cork of my first bottle of JOT that this was something special. I prefer my coffee iced, and 1 Tablespoon of Jot, 7 oz cold water, a splash of cream, and ice shaken in my free Fellows mug brought me to a very happy place. Thank you JOT!",5
3384,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/13/2021,"I love coffee but sometimes that instant coffee has a weird taste to it. A twang, almost. This coffee is delicious. Even the texture makes my drink taste better. I am happy to finally find a coffee that I can make at home iced and TASTY. I limit myself to what I can drink because otherwise I would caffeinate myself to insomnia.",5

3386,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/13/2021,"I was not expecting to LOVE this product. I bought it because my initial offer came with a cute little cup and I’m a sucker for that, plus my birthday was coming up. First day I took some to work with some ice. It kept cold, and I had a delicious ice coffee after lunch and blew through my afternoon with MAX efficiency. It’s not acidic- I hate acidic coffee and I’m kind of picky about my cold brew. I was going through this stuff more quickly that i expected, only to find out that my college age son has been also helping himself to my Jot, “Mom, that ultra coffee is really good.” So now I gotta come up with some sort of long term plan… and they’ve also stolen my new mug. I can’t decide whether or not to recommend this product because it’s so good. And once you try it, you’re going to want it every day and people will steal it from you. I’m desperate to try an affogato, but my kids go through ice cream like they haven’t been fed in days, so I’m going to have to find a good hiding place in the freezer and plan that out…",5

3389,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/12/2021,Easy to prepare and dele,5
3390,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/12/2021,"The coffee tastes great. There is no weird aftertaste or staleness. The suggested ratio is 1tablespoon for 6-8oz of water. I only make iced coffee with it, and I find about 4oz of water works much better. More than that and it is too weak. Also, the caffeine content is pretty high, 150mg, which means I'm not going to have a second cup or make the first one larger. This is unfortunate. But the taste is really good, and keeping with the 1 tablespoon for a serving, they don't seem to have inflated the number of servings per bottle. I will buy it again, but I'll buy more if they come out with decaf or half-caf.",4

Overall, I enjoyed my first cups and feel for a concentrate or powder coffee alternative, Jot is one of the better I have tried.
The area for improvement suggestion I would make is that I like dark roast coffee and Jot is too mild tasting. Even doubling the serving amount helped only some.
Other than that, I would recommend this product.

3500,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/09/2021,I absolutely love this coffee. It is so smooth and not bitter at all. I usually have to spruce up my coffee with flavor because it is too bitter. But Jot is so good just water for me.,5
3501,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/09/2021,I am sensitive to caffeine and coffee usually gives me the jitters and upsets my stomach but I don’t have any problems with JOT and it tastes great! I’ve already signed up for a monthly subscription!!,5
3502,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/09/2021,"This product can be used in so many beverages! 
From iced coffee to octane boost for your current cup.
A little goes a long way,the flavor is awesome. I can tell the concentrate is produced from fine coffee brew.",5
3503,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/09/2021,I’m so glad I took a chance and ordered Jot. It’s so good! Easiest and most convenient way to make coffee. I can’t wait to bring it on our road trips/camping trips.,5
3504,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/09/2021,I just recently tried this for the first time and I love it. Easy to ***** a cup anywhere.,5
3505,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/09/2021,I’m a cold coffee drinker. A Jot ad rolled through my Facebook feed recently and caught my eye. I am so happy that it did! My morning has literally been transformed! The flavor is beyond anything I could have imagined. It is so rich and smooth. And so easy! Perfect every time!,5
3506,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original (Trial),08/09/2021,Perfect for a quick and delicious cup of cold brew! Quick and easy and a great pick me up,5
3507,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/09/2021,"Got it for the promotion, then after trying it believe its a great idea. While it doesn’t replace my french press or Moka Pot, it ls a great addition to the rotation!",5
3508,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/08/2021,We ordered this after seeing it on Instagram and trying it at a friends house. It’s great! It’s plain coffee but it’s solid in taste and top notch in convenience.,5
3509,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/08/2021,I am super picky when it comes to coffee at home and this coffee is 10/10. I am amazed over the flavors that you taste within the coffee. It’s smooth and rich and delicious. Goes well with any creamer and not to mention so easy to make!,5
3510,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/08/2021,I decided to try Jot as an alternative to my usual cup of espresso. My wife sometimes sleeps in and my espresso machine is noisy so I thought I could make a quiet cup of Jot and not desturb her. That first cup was so good I'm enjoying a cup of Jot even when my wife is not sleeping in. Jot is the real deal!,5
3511,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/08/2021,Seriously amazing tasting and super surprised that it really only takes 1tbsp per coffee. I expect companies to brag about serving sizes like this when in reality it takes more to have a decent cup but not with Jot! Ill be subscribing.,5
3512,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/08/2021,"I love the travel mug that came with the Jot-definitely surpassed my yeti of the same size as far as keeping the coffee hot for longer and having a great lip to drink from. Before I comment on Jot, please understand that I am a complete coffee snob. I fresh grind beans right before I use them, weigh them, get the filtered water exactly the right temp, drink it black, etc, etc. Jot just doesn’t get it when compared with freshly brewed coffee in my house. However, I think it is better than granular instant coffee and for the convenience, there may be a time when I’m running short on time or traveling, that it would come in handy",3
3513,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/08/2021,"I was delighted with my Jot coffee order. I’m very particular about a good balance of flavor and this coffee tasted great, wasn’t too acidic, and was so easy to prepare as part of my work routine. I’ll for sure be ordering more in the future!",5
3514,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/08/2021,"This is good coffee. But most importantly its quick and easy to prepare. I work as an ICU nurse and it is so great that I don't have to wait for a brew and deal with cleaning out a filter. I just dump in a mug and go. I expected typical instant coffee taste, but this is a full bodied brew. Will be a regular customer for sure.",5
3515,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original (Trial),08/08/2021,"As a teacher m, this stuff really help me keep going.",5
3516,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/08/2021,"Exactly as expected - have added it to smoothies, water, almond milk, a regular cup of coffee, and just taken it straight (in case of emergency, keep a tablespoon handy). Will keep an extra bottle in the classroom and an IV drip handy in case I need it during the school day - Classes start on the 16th. You running any teacher specials? Buy 1, get two free? Asking for the children and educational purposes...",5
3517,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/08/2021,"I love to add low-fat milk to one tablespoon Jot coffee concentrate. So delicious as an afternoon treat!
Love this coffee ♥️♥️",5
3518,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/08/2021,Would give even more stars if you had a caffeine free product,5
3519,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/08/2021,I just purchased Jot on a whim as a way to take coffee on a camping trip. Wowza! This is the bomb! The best! Think I’ll have some more right now!,5
3520,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/08/2021,"I have honestly tried any and all methods of ingesting iced coffee: DIY cold brew, pour over, Japanese Flash brewing, Starbucks, Caribou, Dunkin etc and nothing is as good as Jot. I usually stick with Starbucks iced coffee but it’s quality & taste is inconsistent and expensive. I’ve had Jot with vanilla oat milk over ice 5 days in a row and it completely hits the spot!",5
3521,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/08/2021,I love this stuff. I can't wait to get more. It is delicious and saves me so much time and money. Can't wait to get more.,5
3522,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/08/2021,I was not expecting this coffee to be this amazing. I was very pleasantly surprised. I love that you can make an iced coffee or a hot latte very quickly.,5
3523,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/08/2021,"Very tasty, yes, but the flexibility is amazing. Going on a road trip this fall and Jot is riding along!",5
3524,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/08/2021,"We tried the Jot Ultra Coffee, although it is very convenient to make coffee, there is a slight aftertaste that is similar to freeze dried coffee.",3
3525,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/08/2021,"Love the product. It is very smooth. I normally have agave in my coffee, but I didn’t have to with Jot! It was perfect! I added my salted cream and ice to the coffee, and it was great!",5
3526,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/08/2021,"I’m pretty impressed with Jot, it is the only coffee concentrate I’ve tried that actually tastes like good brewed coffee when it’s mixed, but I have 2 complaints: 

1. It is pretty pricey… I normally drink 12-16oz of coffee a day, so I would be on track to go through a bottle of jot almost every week which ends up being pretty pricey. 

2. Having to measure out with a spoon is an extra step… why not have the bottle lid be a TBSP (or 1/2 TBSP) measuring cup and save the extra step?",4
3527,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/08/2021,I like this coffee as it quick and easy to make if in a hurry. I like it best cold with milk.,5
3528,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/08/2021,Great cup of cold brew. Easy to make. Glad I found the company.,5
3529,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/08/2021,I love how easy this is to use for cold drinks. Last night I put a spoonful over vanilla ice cream with some caramel and it was divine!,5
3530,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/08/2021,"Jot is my new favorite iced coffee drink! It’s very convenient to make at home and travel to work.
Great flavor, I’ll be ordering again!",5
3531,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/08/2021,"I don’t have a huge need for concentrated coffee in my life. I’ve bought the grinder, a gooseneck electric kettle with temp. control and I do pour overs. I’m generally pretty satisfied with the constraints of my coffee ecosystem. But Jot makes some reasonable claims. The coffee is smooth and lacks the sour acidity that I have passionately avoided. I take it with cream, no sugar. But I’ve trialed it straight, and its quite good! And the convenience is starting to lure me a bit. Yes, it's a luxury. Yes, you should buy from local roasters, if possible. But this is bottled in glass, can travel, takes up *no* Counterspace, is a great way to make larger quantities of coffee for guests and is shelf stable for a longer period of time. Definitely recommend giving it a try.",4
3532,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/08/2021,This is a great coffee that’s light and refreshing ! Super easy to make ajs well worth it!! We love this - especially great for camping and traveling!,5
3533,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/08/2021,"I drink a fair bit of tea and coffee, and I wanted to try this out after seeing adverts for it repeatedly on Instagram. The coffee is good, but 1tbsp doesn't always cut it, especially if you're not drinking it straight. That's the biggest downside that I find myself pouring extra than what is recommended, and burning through the bottle fast. The coffee is slightly more acidic than what I prefer, but mixing it with alkaline water has resolved that issue. Overall, good flavor considering the convenience factor. I'm definitely impressed as I was sure it was just some big marketing scheme with no founding on a good product. I was pleasantly proven wrong, by a easy cup of cold brew or hot coffee, that I can make quickly before going to work!",4
3534,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/08/2021,My husband has an obsession with iced coffee so I got this for him to try and he loves it!,5
3535,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/08/2021,I ordered jot and it came super fast. I love iced coffee and this is smooth and not bitter at all. 10 out 10 would recommend to anyone who has no time in the morning to brew coffee.,5
3536,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/08/2021,Much cheaper than going to Starbucks every day!,5
3537,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/08/2021,"We have an expresso maker and enjoy the ritual of making our morning lattes, however, jot is quickly becoming a household favorite. Perfect for grab and go, travel and we are taking it camping next weekend! Excellent product. So good!",5
3538,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/08/2021,"So I honestly am not a big coffee drinker mainly because most coffee gives me more jitteriness and anxiety than alertness. I can’t say the same occurs with Jot. Not only does it truly taste amazing but I feel great after drinking it. The convenience of being able to make my coffee in all of 60 seconds is another huge bonus. It’s definitely a little pricier than other at home instant coffees but it’s quality is just insurmountable. And if you were to compare the time and money you save to buying similar quality coffee at a coffee shop, it’s a no brainer. Whatever you guys are doing over here at Jot just keep doing it cause it’s working",5
3539,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/08/2021,"I love it because of the convenience, but the flavor IMO isn't the best I've ever tasted. But still better than any other instant coffee I've tried.. just not as good as the real thing!",4
3540,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/08/2021,I have found my new coffee concentrate in Jot. Great flavor and so smooth. Will definitely order again.,5
3541,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/08/2021,"If you're looking for good, easy to make coffee, look no further",5
3542,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/08/2021,Really impressed with this product! Planning to keep the RV stocked - makes hot or cold coffee quick and easy (love not having the cleanup of grounds too…) and the taste is fantastic.,5
3543,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/08/2021,Yummy stuff. Easy to use in lots of ways. I take a TBS with 8-10 ounces of cold cashew milk and a few drops of liquid stevia. It tastes like coffee ice cream! I also added it to my fat bomb recipe.,5
3544,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/08/2021,"I like coffee a lot, but this coffee I could very easily LOVE LOVE
Just a bit pricey for me at this time.:)",5
3545,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/07/2021,This coffee is awesome I wanna thank Thomas Delauer for promoting this product or else I would of never found out about this,5
3546,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/07/2021,The coffee is very good. It makes getting out the door in the morning a bit quicker and you can tell its quality coffee.,5
3547,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/07/2021,It’s crazy to think that one tablespoon of goodness can bring such joy to your cup! Love it!,5
3548,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/07/2021,Im really hooked on Jot for my iced coffee. Ive gotten down to 1/4 left in my first bottle. Ive been using Jot to make my morning coffee drink the last week and half. For a change today i went to my old stand by favorite coffee to make my iced drink. I ended up dumping the pot and went right back to Jot because i missed it already. Great stuff,5
3549,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/07/2021,I could not believe how great JOT tasted. And it was so simple to make my iced coffee. I have not tried it hot yet but I am simply satisfied!,5
3550,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/07/2021,Glad I found it and love it. I use it to make nitro cold brew in my growler werks coffee maker. It’s a much faster way to get a ready to drink cold brew thanks to Jot.,5
3551,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/07/2021,"This is the best coffee by far. Love, love love it!!",5
3552,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/07/2021,"I don’t feel like it is very strong, perhaps a different bean could be used… this is personal preference of course. But product shipped quickly and the free mug was awesome.",3
3553,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/07/2021,"I haven't been a person that previously that could do or create things early in the morning for myself - like coffee. Jot is DELICIOUS and so easy to put together, I've found myself quickly getting myself that cup before i run out the door SO easily and I feel SO good about having accomplished that and given future-at-work-me the gift of a delicious cup of coffee :)",5
3554,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/07/2021,"To be honest, my wife and I were a little skeptical going into our first taste of JOT as we love to grind our own coffee and American press it… but JOT blew us away!! 
SOOO good and delicious, quick to make, easy to vary strength, and wonderful hot or cold.
We’ll definitely be returning to buy more.
Thanks JOT gang for making such an excellent product!
😎😊",5
3555,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/07/2021,Best thing since brewed coffee.,5
3556,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/07/2021,This is the best concentrate I have ever tasted. Takes such a small amount to make a great iced coffee. It's a winner,5
3557,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/07/2021,I have tried a few other brands but none compare to jot. Jot had the best flavor out of all the competition. Did not taste watered down one bit. I love my coffee strong and this gave me the same feel as a cold brew.,5
3558,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/07/2021,I love iced coffee and this make the best iced coffee I’ve ever had. I love it so much!! I will be a customer forever!!,5
3559,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/07/2021,Jot is smooth and delicious! It might not be affordable for me on the long run but I absolutely adored it as an occasional treat!!!,5
3560,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/07/2021,This coffee is fantastic and so easy to use. I will definitely buy more in the future,5
3561,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/07/2021,I am very much enjoying the unique flavor this coffee offers. It’s whole idea is great. I love having the option to make double strength coffee in a matter of seconds. It pairs well with syrups for flavoring or just by itself. 10/10 would recommend this coffee to anyone!,5
3562,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/07/2021,"I tried this and another brand of quick coffee (Cometeer). I personally felt the other brand had a richer and stronger flavor, but having to defrost adds another step. Jot is super quick and easy.",4
3563,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/07/2021,I was skeptical ordering something new online but this arrived and I can’t stop drinking it! Ordering more so I don’t run out!,5
3564,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/07/2021,Love this. Tastes great. Easy to make and doesn’t make me feel jittery like your normal every day strong coffee.,5
3565,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/07/2021,"Haven’t done a concentrate of coffee before, this is great stuff! Mix mine with Vanilla almond milk.",5
3566,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/07/2021,Getting ready for a cross county drive and Jot is the perfect way to make sure I’ve got good coffee with me the entire time. Yes!,5
3567,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/07/2021,Excellent flavor and so convenient when prepping in the morning for work,5
3568,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original (sub),08/07/2021,"I was referred to Jot by a friend, she raved about the product. I ordered it right away being I drink coffee every morning, this sounded fantastic! Who couldn’t use more caffeine?! I was impressed by the packaging when Jot arrived. Jot has a supreme flavor and is super convenient considering I only drink my coffee at home. 
This would make a great gift to other coffee lovers!",5
3569,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original (sub),08/07/2021,Excellent product. Make making my bullet proof coffee so much easier.,5
3570,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/07/2021,Hot is very conscientious for coffee on the run. Normally I do pour over coffee but sometimes when I’m on the run Jot works great,5
3571,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/07/2021,"Honestly, it was really good. I'm one of those weirdos who loves creamy/milky coffee. Essentially, adding 2tsp to 7oz of milk + ice made the best iced coffee I've had at home! Will definitely be reordering!",5
3572,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/07/2021,"I've tried a few different concentrates over the years. Some of them just tasted harsh or burnt and you had to use a lot for the mix to taste right. Not Jot. Jot is thick in a good way and very smooth tasting. It makes a cold coffee that's just as good as my local coffee shop cold jar, and you really only need one tablespoon. You won't regret trying it. In fact, you'll wish you ordered more.",5
3573,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/07/2021,I absolutely love this stuff. Wish it came with the measuring spoon though tbh. It’s a pain not having a dedicated thing for this and now I regret not adding to cart,5
3574,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original (sub),08/07/2021,"I’m obsessed with Jot! It’s so smooth - none of the bitterness you get with some cold brew. I haven’t tried it hot yet, but it’s fantastic cold with a little milk.",5
3575,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/07/2021,"Jot saves time and energy in the morning, I love how customizable it is and find myself making it a bit stronger then recommended. Great for mornings were brewing coffee isn’t an option.",5
3576,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/07/2021,Just recently order (2) bottles of JOT and a few additional items. I received the package and it was missing one item. I notified the JOT customer service team and they immediately dispatched the missing item. Great customer service and customer care. I tried a tbsp in my cappuccino instead of espresso and as a cold brew alternative. It tasted great as a cold brew with water and milk. A little light as an espresso replacement. Will definitely order again 🙂,5
3577,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/07/2021,Love having coffee always made and having the choice between hot or iced. Too easy to taste so good!,5
3578,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/07/2021,"This product is lovely and worth it. I can make a nice coffee drink so easily and it tastes fantastic. As a vegan, it is important to me to have high quality products.",5
3579,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/07/2021,"Made an iced coffee with my Jot. It was delicious, strong, and was just what I wanted. Caffeinated up for my busy day. Yummy!",5
3580,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/06/2021,"I didn’t expect much. I saw an ad for Jot and on a whim, I ordered. I’ll be honest, my expectations were low. I just wanted something to replace my semi-regular Starbucks runs which cost far too much and took way too much time. I found Jot to be even better than expected. It’s easy, incredibly aromatic, and tasty. I’m a convert!",5
3581,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/06/2021,I always made cold brew and the process is time consuming so I gave this a try and love it the simplicity of my life now.,5
3582,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/06/2021,"Slightly bitter cup of iced coffee. And if you have seen an unboxing video, don’t expect a fancy box or even a measuring spoon for the high price. All you get is a mediocre cup of coffee! (Three stars is generous as I am not a coffee aficionado. If you are, save your money)",3
3583,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original (sub),08/06/2021,"I really have one sacred practice in my life and it’s my coffee. This has made my morning iced coffee SO good that I’d rather have coffee at home than visit my local Starbucks, etc. I feel like I’ve leveled up!",5
3584,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/06/2021,"Pleasantly surprised. I drive a semi for concert tours, and many times we can not stop from show to next show. This is perfect. A quality micro roast flavor on the go. So perfect for what I do. And truck stop coffees are awful.",5
3585,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/06/2021,"Ordered 2 bottles of JOT on a whim after seeing an advertisement online… not something I generally do, as I can be picky about flavor, concentration, preparation, etc. Needless to say, I was PLEASANTLY surprised by the flavor (rich, aromatic, not acidic) and am pleased by the sustainable glass bottles. I keep two bottles in the fridge and add 8 oz of cold milk in the mornings for the easiest and best cup of “cold brew” coffee I’ve had in years. I’ve only just finished the first of two bottles and am ordering two more bottles right now.",5
3586,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/06/2021,The best cold coffee I’ve had. So yummy!!,5

3588,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/06/2021,"Y’all. Listen. I’ve been on instant coffee for about a year now because it’s convenient. I’ve tried the best brands (Café Bustelo’s isn’t too terrible), but nothing compares to Jot. I was skeptical due to price, but it’s far and away worth the ~$2 per cup. Get this stuff. Love it.",5

3591,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/06/2021,"I do not drink caffeine even tho I love the taste of coffee. If this was caffeine free, I would have bought some for myself.

Says it tastes great too.",5
3592,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/06/2021,"I have tried other concentrates and let me tell you, Jot puts them to shame. The flavor is smooth and delicious. The bottle design is the best too, no dripping and wasting any deliciousness!",5
3593,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/06/2021,"The coffee itself was good - I much prefer it in an iced latte than to an iced coffee or hot coffee, as its ability to retain the creaminess of a latte is the main draw for me - but I wish it would have come with a measuring spoon!",4
3594,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original (sub),08/06/2021,"Made I husband and I to us copies as soon as I got it. Wanted to be able to carry some coffee with me on our camping trip this would be a good solution to my coffee addiction.

I signed up for monthly subscription looks like I’m gonna be needing it lol!",5

3597,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/06/2021,It’s great to be able to whip up a great drink in about 1 minute. Most convenient way to have a wide variety of drink options. Only issue is keeping from drinking the bottle too quickly.,5

Now I have my own and I need to ration it or I’ll never sleep. I haven’t tried it hot yet because I love it iced so much. Maybe in the winter I’ll do more hot Jot!
Thanks,",5

3601,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/06/2021,"I wasn't sure exactly what to expect. I have several different coffee makers at home and have been experimenting with homemade cold brew. This looked like a low fuss way to get some iced coffee so I decided to give it a try. My 1st try was a TBS of Jot coffee, ice cubes, and milk. It was really rich and had a terrific coffee flavor. Now I use ice, part water, part milk and eye-ball the coffee. It is so good, I've been having two a day. Now I just wish it came in decaf so I could have it later in the day,",5
3602,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original (sub),08/06/2021,"Jot is so unbelievably good that I hate it. It’s simply ruined other coffee for me. My old coffee shop misses me, they ask where I’ve been. It’s been weeks that I’ve seen them. I told them I’ve moved onto bigger and better things. I told them I’ve moved on to Jot. I didn’t know there could be too much of a good thing. Too convenient, too delicious, too affordable. I’m addicted and the only thing I can do is buy more Jot. Help.",5
3603,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/06/2021,OMG I am so happy I tried this Ultra Coffee! It is 10x better than Starbucks and way cheaper too! I can get 12 oz out if a tbsp and I am super happy with that.,5

3629,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/04/2021,I love coffee and I actually make my own cold brew every few weeks but sometimes the actually process of making it is time consuming. When I saw an ad on Jot I was a bit skeptical but I figure I’d give it a try. When I received the package and made my first cup of iced coffee I was very pleasantly surprise how good it was. It was smooth and has the natural sweetness of the coffee and does not taste old like many store bought coffees. Also I love how it’s so easy and quick to make especially on a busy morning when I have to rush to get the kids ready for school and get to work on time.,5
3630,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/04/2021,I'm a truck driver and this works perfect for making iced coffee when I start my day. It can be mixed with virtually anything. It even tastes great just as coffee with nothing in it.,5

3634,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/04/2021,"Hi Jot team,

I really appreciate what you all are trying to do with Jot- a really convenient not burnt/ gross cold brew concentrate. Overall loved it (and the fact that it's a Colorado product makes me a CO local feel good inside). A couple things I felt- one is that it doesn't feel like there's 140-150 mg of coffee in a single tablespoon. I'm pretty sensitive to caffeine and it certainly feels like there's half of the good stuff in there than the website sates. That makes me need 2 tablespoons for a good cup, and makes my morning coffee cost as much as a starbucks coffee which isn't ideal. The other thing is that the flavor of one tablespoon feels a little weak/ shallow in 8-12 oz of liquid.

Relative to nespresso and other coffee concentrates, you guys are absolutely killing it. Relative to a local roaster with fresh beans I think there's a bit to be desired.",4
3635,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/04/2021,"Smooth and delious, Jot takes the guess work out of whatever style of coffee you need in the morning. 1 tablespoon and 8oz of water, blended with MCT oil and collagen protein makes my perfect iced coffee in the AMs now.",5
3636,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/04/2021,"Shocked at how good this stuff is. I've had it hot, iced, black, and with milk. My favorite might be an oat milk latte. Hands down the easiest way to get some really great coffee without any effort.",5
3637,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/04/2021,I’m not sure what I expected for flavor but Jot is really good!,5
3638,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/04/2021,"We followed the instructions for 1 Tbsp per 8oz hot water (or 7oz cold) and we preferred the cold version, however, this formula wasn't strong enough for our taste so we upped the dose to 1.5 Tbsp. All in all, good flavor and happy with the product. We look forward to different flavors and strengths that you and your team might come up with in the future.",4
3639,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/04/2021,"I've been buying cold brew coffee from the grocery store for my iced coffee, but finally decided to try Jot. I'm so glad that I did. It's handy, tastes delicious, and I can make a hot cup of coffee just as easily by adding water from my electric kettle. Oh, and one little bottle goes a long way. Shipping was fast too. Super pleased!",5
3640,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/04/2021,I love my iced coffee at about 2PM. It’s quick and easy and it tastes sooooo smooth.,5
3641,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/03/2021,Jot makes me wonder why I spent the last 3 years meticulously hand-grinding my coffee beans and then making individual pour over cups of coffee for myself. Why did I do that? Because there was no faster single-cup option available that actually tasted good. Somehow Instagram ads knew this and damn my wallet but I'm hooked on Jot now. It is so easy and so delicious. My old ceramic pour-over dripper is wondering where she went wrong...,5
3642,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/03/2021,"I love iced coffee, but it can be such a hassle to make a pitcher of it, or if you get a premade solution the quality can be all over the place. The Jot coffee I ordered tasted fantastic when mixed with oat milk, iced water, and with hot water and it's a breeze to portion out 1 scoop of the stuff and just get going. I'll definitely be ordering some more when I run out.",5
3643,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/03/2021,"I have tried a similar product, that product was a little cheaper but the shipping took forever, Jot came in the mail the next day. Jot actually smells/tastes like coffee, not some weird 'spent way too long extracting' chemically smell. Jot also doesn't have a thick sludge left behind in the bottle, and the top was designed not to spill and leave coffee stains in the fridge.",5
3644,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/03/2021,I was a bit skeptical about this product but I was happily surprised. Jot is the real deal and delivers great flavor and dept. have used it for hot coffee and ice coffee and this will be my go to drink from now on. Recently brought a bottle with me on a hiking trip and it was fantastic. You have to try it.,5
3645,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/03/2021,I’m new to Jot coffee but so far hot or cold it tastes great. Quick shipping and good customer service to address questions,5
3646,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/03/2021,I have tasted a lot of concentrated coffee but Jot coffee blew all those out the water. The smooth taste and the ease of use makes this a perfect travel coffee!,5
3647,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/03/2021,"The coffee has such a rich flavor, and the best part is that you can have it ready in no time at all. Plus depending on your mood, it is easy to enjoy an iced coffee or a warm steaming mug.",5
3648,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original (sub),08/03/2021,I'll definitely be buying this again. Delicious and so easy to make. I'm enjoying having it cold this summer. Fast shipping and delicious taste you can tailor to your own taste!!,5
3649,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/03/2021,Tried Jot coffee on a whim and I’m hooked! My husband and I love making it into a cold brew. SO GOOD!,5
3650,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/03/2021,By far one of my favorite coffee drinking experiences. I'm a big fan of the smooth mouth feel and consistent flavor. It's the easiet and tastiest coffee routine I've done.,5
3651,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/03/2021,I used to buy my coffee every morning. Now I look forward to my Jot coffee at home and haven’t been to the coffee shop in a month! So easy and delicious.,5
3652,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/03/2021,"Not my everyday coffee because of caffeine content, but good for days when you need it. Flavor is intense for the amount used. Overall good product that gives me caffeine intensity and flavor when I want it.",5
3653,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/03/2021,"I like coffee drinks, but hate the bitterness so much that I add a a ton of extras to mask the taste. Jot is so smooth. A little creamer, a single spoon full of chocolate syrup and Jot is A-Mazing!",5
3654,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original (Trial),08/03/2021,"I really didn’t expect it to be this good. I was pleasantly impressed.
My only regret. . .
I should have ordered the tablespoon.",5
3655,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/03/2021,"I had low expectations for this, but the quality of the cup and the overall taste is excellent. I love going through the process of selecting beans, grinding them for specific brew methods, and taking my time to do so...but when I'm pressed for time, or am just feeling lazy, this ticks all of the boxes.",5
3656,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/03/2021,I really enjoyed my first bottle but probably can’t justify the price. At about $1.71 per cup that doesn’t take any spillage until account. I may buy a bottle if they run huge sales but otherwise probably won’t purchase again.,3
3657,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/03/2021,"Quick, easy and delicious! The versatility of Jot was the reason I bought a bottle. I took it camping and was able to enjoy my coffee without lugging around brewing equipment! 10/10!",5
3658,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/03/2021,Mainly bought this because I'm going camping coming up and I knew this would be an easy guarantee for my caffeine fix. It also is fun to froth with milk to feel a little extra fancy. ;),5
3659,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/03/2021,This is a non bitter coffee. I had mine iced with a splash of cream and it was very nice.,4

3661,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/03/2021,"The idea isn’t new but the execution certainly is. 
Absolute brilliant cold or hot brew in a rush. Very mellow and not for you acid-heads, but nonetheless a great cup of coffee. Will make for some ace cocktails too.",5
3662,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/03/2021,"Good, strong espresso. I’d prefer it mixed with oat milk/milk. I wouldn’t drink this mixed with hot water as a replacement for espresso shot. But it’s better than Nespresso.",4

3664,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/03/2021,I feel like I’m a fancy coffee connoisseur,5
3665,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/03/2021,"It’s actually pretty decent. I was pleasantly surprised. When you math it out, it’s not that cheap, but it’s really really good compared to your typical good quality bean home brew.",5
3666,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/03/2021,I’m grumpy when I wake up and who isn’t but Jot legit makes life better. It’s too easy to get coffee now. Thanks for making my life just a little easier.,5
3667,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/02/2021,Originally was skeptical of Jot thinking how this can compare with a freshly grind and brewed coffee but this has proved me wrong. Jot is as good and more convenient than the pour over I make each morning. Will definitely recommend.,5
3668,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/02/2021,I've been loving Jot for quick cold coffee on these hot summer mornings. It had saved me a lot of time in making homemade cold brew and it tastes delicious. Looking forward to using in while on the road and camping!,5
3669,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/02/2021,We are totally enjoying our iced coffee. It’s definitely as smooth as the best cold from our local coffee stop. Will definitely order again.,5
3670,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/02/2021,"*Love the coffee whether cold or hot. * Costs the same as a a bag of beans and I don't have to grind anything. I must say, that JOT is much stronger and has a wonderful flavor of coffee! * The only thing is that the instructions says, to add 7oz of water, it just doesn't say, how much JOT to make a 7oz cup?",5
3671,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/02/2021,Tastes better than any other cold brew on the market and I love that a tiny bottle can last me 10+ days!,5

3673,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/02/2021,I love drinking black coffee but most I’ve tasted have such a bitter aftertaste. Ultra coffee is so smooth and has deep flavor.,5
3674,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/02/2021,"Delicious coffee that’s much cheaper and easier than running to the coffeeshop down the street. Add the fact that they threw in a mug means a much more environmentally friendly brew. Love the taste, love the mug, love the convenience.",5

3677,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/02/2021,"Definitely got ""influeced"" by jot, but don't be fooled - this stuff is the real deal. It's roughly the same cost as the cold brew concentrates you can get from the grocery store, but way more convenient.

3681,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/02/2021,Haven’t tried Jot yet. Waiting to take on trip at end of August. Bought to try based on a friends recommendation.,5
3682,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/02/2021,"I was skeptical like you are now reading all the reviews, but I will tell you you won’t regret it once you try it! I have had so many coffees looking for my favorite coffee shop this doesn’t disappoint in comparison to those. It is stop, bold, tasteful, if YOY just want black coffee not too bitter at all, great hot or iced!!! Get the spoon is helpful to know your doing the right proportions and you don’t need more well unless your making a double batch cup!:) I will say it has a distinct flavor yes it’s good strong coffee but also slightly different for me in a good way I love it not the bitterness it’s all the goodness of coffee! Everyone I have made try it has enjoyed it as well so even though it’s slight different then my regular cup of coffee I might make at home it is strong like a cup I have gotten at a coffee shop so the boldness and profile of flavors don’t disappoint! I also doing school still it is great, fast, easy to make I so one scoop jot, about half cup water pending how much coffee I want them flavor creamer for perfect cup every time giving me the caffeine boost I know many look for in coffee!

3684,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/02/2021,A good cup. Simple coffee. Better than Starbucks but not as good as coffee shop coffee. Cometeer coffee has more flavor. But this is a good option for an even quicker quality cup. All is welcome in my home!,5
3685,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/02/2021,I was really impressed with how nice and smooth the cup of coffee was from Jot. I just added some cold oat milk and ice and it was the perfect cup of iced coffee.,5
3686,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/02/2021,"I’m a bit of a coffee snob and this passes the test. Really tasty, and you can alter the flavor with different ratios of water to Jot, or by using milk, carbonated water, etc. It’s also convenient that it’s so concentrated. Doesn’t take up much room in your fridge (or bag if you’re camping or traveling) but still gives you several cups. The branding and packaging is a major bonus but in this case - all the glitter is definitely gold.",5
3687,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/02/2021,I need stronger coffee in the am as it takes a lot for me to wake up. The Jot bottle will last me much longer than the 2 plastic bottles of starbucks iced coffee that I drink in 4 days. Yay for saving plastic!,5

3700,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original (sub),08/01/2021,"I didn’t know what to expect when I ordered this product — I was lured in by an Instagram ad. The high-profile reviews and coupon for a first order convinced me to give it a go. I’m an everyday coffee drinker who will regularly spend 4.00 on a Starbucks cold brew, so this is actually a cheaper alternative. I also make cold brew at home but I’ve never quite gotten it right and my brews quickly sour, or are bitter or funky and have to be “fixed” with sweetener.

Jot comes in a lovely glass bottle with a spout easy to slowly pour from, and tastes great with JUST cold water and ice. Typically I add almond milk and a tiny splash of syrup, but this coffee needs NOTHING. The taste is so smooth it is fine on its own and really tastes great… like cold-brewed coffee. Because that’s exactly what it is.

I’m rarely impressed by an ad-driven purchase, but I must say Jot (also: Billie razors and ZipTop silicone storage bags) really came through. I will happily continue my subscription with Jot. :)",5

3702,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/01/2021,I really love this coffee so far. My only ask is I want one of those cool spoons! And oh my goodness the Fellow mug that came with it keeps the ice frozen for hours and hours. How amazing. I assume it does the same with hot.,5
3703,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee Extra Bottle (14 Cups),08/01/2021,Love it ,5
3704,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/01/2021,Easy to make and taste pretty good. My go to is the Vietnamese coffee.,5
3705,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/01/2021,"I ordered this when I started a new job and I needed an easy way to get coffee while I was still basically asleep, haha. It definitely does the trick, I feel awake and energized and it tastes way better than instant powder coffee. It isn’t quite as strong of a flavor as I would have hoped, and the bottles don’t hold a full 14 tablespoons, so your last cup of coffee is only a half a cup, which I find a bit annoying. So for me, it’s a strong 4 star product.",4
3706,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/01/2021,JOT is an amazing product. You can taste the exceptional quality. I use it in my yogurt and smoothies in addition to adding it to almond or oat milk. Thanks for a great product.,5
3707,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/01/2021,"It tastes fine, but the cost to cup ratio isn’t economical for anyone who drinks more than one measured cup of coffee a day. If you’re the kind of person who wakes up, has one cup and goes about their day or only has it when they need a boost, then it’ll probably work for you. If you’re someone who drinks multiple cups a day and comes from a family where coffee is considered a dessert, then you’re going to be going through a bottle in less than a week.",3

3711,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/01/2021,"I loved the idea of a complex coffee making process in the morning. It seemed like something the cool kids do that give you a leg up on your day, but also gave you extra bonus point for being a coffee snob. As time went by I just realized how much I hated grinding, weighing, measuring, boiling, waiting… enter Jot coffee. I didn’t have high expectations at first but wow. I’ve never looked forward to my morning (and afternoon) coffee so much in my life. It’s so easy, so tasty, and gives you so many combinations of how to make your cup o joe just the way you feel like it in the moment. Thanks Jot for making me enjoy the coffee experience again.",5

Buying coffee from Philz, Starbucks, and Peet’s every day wasn’t practical. I decided to give Jot a try since it’s inexpensive and a lot cheaper than buying drinks and it’s perfect.

Also beats making my own cold brew at home; so much smoother and not a flake of silt to be found!

Taste-wise, I'm finding deeper and more chocolatey notes than I was expecting, which isn't specifically to my palate, so the flavor profile isn't ""100%"" there for me personally. That said, given all the benefits above, I expect to be a Jot customer for a good while to come. Great product!",4

It's great to drink alone or mixed up with other ingredients such as milk or Caramel, and we just tried it with alittle milk and apple puree to lightly sweeten it without sugar. Also, it's just a very versatile product in general. Since it's so strong, we can even possibly add it into baked goods. Possibly infusing it into dishes too!

BTW, I love the team members that we have worked with over CS!

It’s not EXACTLY the same as a latte, but after buying an espresso machine this is probably the next best option if you want espresso-style drinks at home.

Unfortunately, with a one y/o and another on the way, time is no longer an option. I was initially skeptical but I've been pleasantly surprised by Jot.

Jot is a delicious alternative to stopping for coffee every morning! Because it’s so easy (just add cold water for iced coffee) it’s also great to keep at work!

It's the first time I've bought it and it's a good coffee, but I think I could buy it every time I get a small discount. :(",5
3830,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/27/2021,I love the convenience of JOT & the smooth taste. Now I just need JOT to make a white coffee bean version.,5

3832,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/27/2021,"Ah, simplicity and goodness. Love having these bottles on hand for a quick morning/afternoon/evening (yes, evening too) pick me up!!

I love the versatility, the space it saves, the environmental aspect, and the taste. It's all things great.",5

3839,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/26/2021,"Having coffee ready to go has been really convenient! I often forget to set up my cold brew ahead of time, so having Jot around has helped solve that problem. I also like being able to measure out how much coffee I want that day and know how much caffeine I am getting (vs it being more of a guess with cold brew)...less chance of getting over-caffeinated and jittery. It tastes pretty good - not quite as good as fresh brewed when I drink it plain, but when I add my normal oat milk splash, it's honestly very similar. It's about the same price per cup as the coffee I use for cold brew, too. My only wish is that I could get different roasts - I enjoy being able to switch it up a bit with my coffee at home, but there is just the one flavor with Jot.",4
3840,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/26/2021,"My expectations were surpassed! It’s smooth, easy to make, and even easier to drink! I’ve made it cold with condensed milk (Thai iced coffee) as well as hot with regular creamer. It’s delish!!!",5
3841,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/26/2021,I can pour a cup of milk in my thermos add a tablespoon of Jot and a pump of vanilla and I have a delicious iced coffee that has plenty of caffeine. It’s almost too convenient!,5
3842,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/26/2021,"Tastes great, and quick to share. I’m a picky coffee person, and struggle to let go and not spend an hour making 6 people coffees on my espresso machine at home. Jot makes a fantastic and ridiculously easy and fast alternative to my more labor intensive methods. Will buy again.",5
3843,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/26/2021,"Until now! I bought a bottle of Jot for my husband and daughter who love the big name brand. I have never tried coffee in my life, just never had the desire. They were skeptical of it, but excited to try it out. My husband did straight up with hot water and followed the directions provided. He said that it was probably one of the best cups of coffee that he has had, especially coming from a concentrated bottle. 
Daughter had the Brown Sugar recipe with the cinnamon. She said it was so good, and so delicious and again, smooth, not acidy or bitter. She kept asking me to try it, I kept telling her no, but finally relented, and WOW!!! It was really tasty and not bitter like I thought coffee would be. 
Also had to say, she liked it so much that she ordered two bottles for herself to take to college. And our first bottle is nearly gone! Great job Jot!",5

I haven’t tried it hot yet, but I have high hopes that it will transition to fall/winter hot lattes and americanos well.

I am definitely a Jot fan!",5

Is there anyway I could get another???",5
3855,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/26/2021,Not nearly as good as making a nice pour over at home but it’s definitely convenient and good enough for when time is tight. For the price though not something I’ll be continuing with.,3

3867,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/25/2021,"The first time I made the Vietnamese Iced Coffee from the recipe card in my Fellow insulated mug, I had to stop myself from drinking another cup right away. It was just that damn good and I’ve been enjoying a quick afternoon cup everyday since my shipment arrived a couple weeks ago. Glad I got the two bottle shipment so I won’t need to wait while my next shipment is on its way (which only took a few days)!",5
3868,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/25/2021,Very very good coffee but I don’t know why even though my daughters hasn’t expired that it tastes different. The ones I received with a September expiration taste great the July and August bottles we are using aren’t so great.,5

I have an espresso maker at home, but have found that I either can't drink lattes when I travel or need to spend $$$$ at coffee shops. This is PERFECT for my latte fix while traveling, and it's such a great idea! I already got my uncle addicted (who likes it for the ease/simplicity/lack of mess), and can't wait to introduce it to everyone else and get them addicted too! Definitely placing more orders!!",5
3877,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/25/2021,"Have to admit, was hesitant at first because of the way you have to stir in the coffee off of 1 tbsp of Jot. But almost two weeks in, its my go to coffee daily! I usually add in some sweetened condensed milk, and some says I drink 2 cups! So 1 bottle does last 2+ weeks taking into account I drink 2 cups on some days. Given people usually spend $4-5 on cold brew at other shops/chains, you can spend that on a bottle of Jot. So you get the at home convenience and value. Will definitely buy more!",5

3921,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee Extra Bottle (14 Cups),07/22/2021,"I enjoy its simplicity and that it does not take up much room in the fridge.

The cherry on top is the reusability of the glass bottles - they make such cute vases and sauce containers! If you’re on the fence, just give it a shot. Soon you’ll be like me, trying to convince all my friends to try it too (@ Jot please sponsor me LOL jk… unless…)",5
3931,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/21/2021,"I live in a resort town overrun by tourists. Lately, grocery stores have been incapable with keeping up with bottled iced coffee demands.

Highly recommend it.",5

3935,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/21/2021,"I like the convenience of it, and the flavor is ok... But it's a bit overpriced for what you get. I will say it was nice to add to my existing coffee to boost the flavor, but I mean, who only drinks an 8 ounce cup of coffee a day and would pay $28 for a bottle?? I'm sure packaging and shipping fees are part of the cost, but still.. I'm glad I got to try for a discount, but I don't think I'll be ordering again.",3
3936,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/21/2021,"Jot has been a great time saver--especially for making iced coffee in the middle of summer. No more waking up earlier to make coffee, and it's just as good as fresh brewed iced coffee!",5

3939,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/20/2021,I can’t lie.. I ordered this product expecting to be disappointed- I am pleased to say I was not!! The ultra concentrated coffee was extremely delicious! I’ve preferred it diluted with water over milk though. I felt like I needed more concentrate to get a better flavor out of a milk-based beverage as opposed to water. I’ll definitely be ordering more. One to keep at home and one to keep at the office.,5
3940,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/20/2021,"I was gifted jot and the experience was so easy and the product was so delicious I immediately ordered another.

3946,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/19/2021,"I just finished my first bottle of Jot and I have to say…. Wow! I’ve been struggling to replicate my ever-loved latte with my coffee maker at home. I resorted to buying Starbucks jugs of premade, latte. Love those too, but I love being able to make my own coffee with less sugar and more flavor - plus supporting a small brand is fabulous too. If you’re a coffee lover, you must try Jot!",5
3947,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/19/2021,"I really like this coffee and love how versatile it is. It tastes a little different than what I expected, but it's not bad by any means and I like how strong it is. I tend to stick with 6oz water rather than 8oz so it's really strong! I'll probably continue with it because it's easy and the cost works out to be way cheaper than Starbucks or even ****** Dunkin.",4
3948,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/19/2021,I had fairly low expectations when I ordered it but thought it might be a good substitute for making espresso at home. I mixed my 1st cup with ice and oatmilk and was blown away. This coffee is so good it doesn’t require sugar or cream to taste rich and smooth. I’ve been hooked ever since. My second order was 4 bottles!,5
3949,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/19/2021,I guess after all the reviews and the buildup I was expecting a better tasting coffee. I’m sorry. For the expense and the volume amount in the bottles I’m going back to the pods. JOT didn’t wow me or my husband. I’m sorry that’s not the answer you wanted. I’ve just sent an order for JAVY we’ll see.,3
3950,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/19/2021,I was initially skeptical about buying ultra coffee but I am so glad I did! This coffee is amazing and so versatile and now my go to coffee choice…even over buying my usual Starbucks! It’s great as iced coffee and lattes. I tried the recipe for the shaken brown sugar latte and it was so delicious!,5
3951,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/19/2021,Loving my Jot so far. Easy to mix (I enjoy it cold) and taste amazing! I love the nutty undertones.,5

3956,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/19/2021,I ordered to bottles of Jot as a quick fix to my need for morning iced coffee and shared it with 12 friends visiting on a *very* hot summer weekend. We devoured the bottles and multiple people bought some to be delivered to their homes on the spot! To satisfy so many kinds of coffee drinkers is a super power!,5
3957,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/18/2021,I took a chance on this because it did seem a little sketchy at first but I ordered some and it is so GOOD!!! Not only does it make iced coffee incredibly easy to make at home but it is easily as good if not better than average coffee from a coffee shop!,5
3958,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/18/2021,"I've only tried this as cold coffee, and am loving the convenience. The taste is good. Maybe the ads I saw on Instagram hyped it too much because I was expecting it to taste better. It's not bad at all though. I'd buy it again to drink cold and add to my protein shakes. It's a great time saver.",4
3959,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/18/2021,"I love the concept and convenience of jot. However, I’m not 100% sold on the taste. When I have it with a little cream, it’s perfect, but when I drink it black (as I drink my coffee most days), it has an odd sour note that I don’t like. I was hoping this would be just fantastic coffee, but I think I’ll be sticking to brewed coffee unless I’m traveling or camping.",4
3960,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/18/2021,I decided to use Jot to switch up my coffee routine from the keurig.

3966,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/18/2021,"Having not enjoyed the flavor of others I’ve tried, I was skeptical of Jot. Joy is nothing like the others! Hot is delicious and super easy to make! I’m love adding a tablespoon of sweetened condensed milk to mine.",5

3970,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/18/2021,"My biggest thing was for iced coffee in the hot summer heat! I’ve tried chilling brewed coffee, brewing my own cold brew, everything!

3974,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee Extra Bottle (14 Cups),07/18/2021,"Jot has exceeded my expectations. I enjoy how easy it is to add caffeine, Jot, to my protein shakes to enjoy on my way to the office. There is no bitterness which is very refreshing and each and every cup tastes the same- something you’re not guaranteed at the local coffee shop! It’s a win for me.",5
3975,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/18/2021,I Really Like this coffee! So fast and easy. the quality is amazing! It saves me money too. I highly suggest trying it. I also like the design of the bottle.,5
3976,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/18/2021,"Okay let me start off by saying that I am not a coffee drinker. I always have wanted to be for the caffeine (I have three wild child boys under the age of 8 so lord help me always), but normal coffee always makes my stomach upset so I never drink it. The first day of trying Jot I had little to no expectations for this to taste good. Let’s be real, how many times have you heard companies claiming to have the best coffee?? **All I can think of is Elf 😂** But for real I was partially dreading even trying it until I remembered that I ordered three bottles (idk why I always do this to myself), and that I may as well have given $40 to my three year old and watch him rip it to shreds if I wasn’t going to at least try it. My initial response was “ew is this even coffee??” It tasted NOTHING like any coffee I have ever had. I thought that it was a bad thing because it was nothing like what other reviews say…except it is EXACTLY WHAT THEY SAY AT THE SAME TIME. Anyway, after my first sip I didn’t taste any bitterness or acidic taste in my mouth so I was thrown off and confused why I didn’t hate it (hence the confusion and knee **** reaction not to like it)…BUT being sleep deprived and at the time a personal trampoline for my three year old, it took me a second to comprehend the liquid gold in my cup. I cannot begin to tell you how hyped I was feeling knowing that I was drinking amazing coffee and that I LIKED IT. Like, what?? I don’t want to vom immediately after and then be unproductive all day bc my stomach is in knots?? Also…I get super pumped up right after I finish my cup…like so pumped I am actually excited to sit down with my three year old and do our farm puzzle for the 47390274930 time. This is not coffee guys, this is a delicious, easy as ****, bomb as **** drink sent down from heaven that gets my tired *** up every day feeling like a new teachers aid who is 25, with no kids and all the patience and energy in the world. Buy it *******. 

Oh last thing, my husband will never admit it because *I bought it and it was my idea***….but he is stealing all of my coffee now instead of his pre workout (but he will never admit how good it is trust me I’ve tried). The fact that he wakes up and starts his day off with it is all I need to know too because he loathes coffee more than I do. If you want to wake up refreshed af as if you didn’t just spend the entire night arguing with your child about why the sun can’t be awake at 4 am-BUY THIS NOW. Trust me.",5
3977,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/18/2021,"I waited a week to taste the product. When I received, I and my wife was so excited. Unfortunately, when we opened and trying to pure into the cup, my child interrupted and ended up dropping the bottle to the ground of the kitchen. We could still sip whatever we had already poured, but rest had to be cleaned up with scattered bottle.

Maybe next time I will try again. It had good smell and taste despite of one sip only was allowed to me.",5
3978,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/18/2021,"I can’t say I’m a morning person, but this coffee makes it so much more bearable to wake up early.",5
3979,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/18/2021,After watching several Instagram ads for this coffee I decided to give it a try and I’m so glad I did! My daughter and I love the flavor and the versatility! Since I’m a hot coffee drinker in the morning and switch to iced in the afternoon I can do so with no fuss! I even signed up for the subscription service!,5

3983,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/18/2021,"When I saw all the reviews, I was a bit skeptical. Many of the ads were on FB and Insta and I figured that influencers had been brought in to hype it up. In any case, I love coffee so I figured I would try it out for myself…and the hype is real. Super quick to make coffee and incredibly smooth, I signed up for a subscription soon after.",5
3984,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/18/2021,I never have to chose between making coffee or being on time for work again. I don’t think it will last me as many cups as advertised but I like my coffee STRONG. Milk frother works good too! I’ve made myself some delicious dirty chai lattes!,5

Once I got it I was super excited and love the taste but it actually took more than a couple tablespoons and I went through the first bottle within three days. I’m not sure I will buy again because it’s pretty expensive to go through so quickly considering my husband and I go through quite a bit of coffee week.",3

3991,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/16/2021,"Jot was an impulse buy when I saw a deal that included a milk frother/heater. I was pleasantly surprised by how smooth and tasty my first cup was. If you're looking for a fast way to get your morning cuppa, this is definitely it. However, the caffeine content is a bit too much for me. Would love to see a half caf or even decaf option in the future. Great product!",4
3992,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/16/2021,I tried Jot on a whim because I saw an ad on social media. Little did I know how much I would love and look forward to my first cup of Ultra Coffee in the morning. Big fan!,5

4006,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/15/2021,I wanted to find a quick and easy way of making iced coffee and Jot just does it for me. I read a few reviews stating that it MIGHT be a bit bitter without any milk but the recommended 1 Tbsp + 7 oz cold water + ice is honestly just what I wanted.,5
4007,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/15/2021,Great taste and less waster.,5
4008,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/15/2021,I really like this coffee. Its very smooth and you can add more or less of the tablespoon depending on how strong you like your coffee.,5
4009,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/15/2021,"Absolutely NO bitterness! That is what I hated about regular coffee, besides all the mess and time of brewing. Try it!! I’ll guarantee you’ll love it!!! ❤️",5
4010,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/14/2021,"My co worker shared this coffee with me and I was hooked! I loved how smooth and delicious this was. I have tried many brands, concentrates you name it I have tried it and this has to be one of the best on my list!",5
4011,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/14/2021,"I just recently started with Jot coffee and it has become my go-to. I like being able to make a delicious cold brew at home and in minutes. I was hesitant at first as I’ve never had ultra concentrated coffee before but… The taste is amazing, both with water and with milk. Will be buying it now for my daily coffee needs.",5
4012,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/14/2021,"Jot has stood up to it's claims. This is a good tasting coffee in a very convenient form for anyone who wants a little more simplicity in their morning. Particularly for me, I like to start my mornings quiet, And I like to track what I'm taking into my body. Quietly heating water, pouring how ever much Jot I want, and stirring in peace with no grinders, and hissing coffee machines is just want I needed!",4
4013,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/14/2021,"I drink iced coffee year-round, and was looking for something easy. This is it! Did I mention it tastes fantastic too?",5

4016,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/14/2021,"I really like that it is just there and available. I brew my own espresso when I want something really good but this is fast and effective. Very good with oat milk and extracts like butterscotch or vanilla. You can also use coffee syrups like usual. Very convenient, will definitely order more.",5
4017,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/14/2021,"My first shipment of Jot arrived at the perfect time — right during our record-breaking Pacific Northwest heat wave. I now enjoy daily cups of iced coffee that satisfy the urge to go buy an iced latte or mocha. The Jot options taste great, and just as welcome is not having to go through the bother of making — and drinking — a hot cup of drip coffee when it’s too hot to enjoy it. I look forward to trying out your recipes, too. I plan to buy again.",5
4018,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/14/2021,"I've tried many at-home iced coffee solutions (bottled, steep packs, and French press) and this is by far the best. Cost-savings are huge compared to going out for coffee. Spring for the glasses and the measuring spoon!",5
4019,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/14/2021,Ok. So I'll admit I was a bit skeptical about whether I would like this product but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. It is perfectly delicious. So far I've only been using it for iced coffee but OMG I do look forward to enjoying it everyday. DE.LI.CIOUS!,5
4020,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/14/2021,I tend to be picky about coffee but this exceeded expectations. Very good coffee.,5
4021,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/13/2021,"I love iced coffee in the summer, but haven’t had much luck with finding an easy way to make it. Jot is the perfect solution! It’s delicious - way better than I expected!!",5
4022,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/13/2021,"Best investment ever!! Was spending way too much on buying Starbucks cold brew, this has the perfect kick and so easy to make my favorite drink at home. Thank you Tik tok for putting me on.",5
4023,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/13/2021,"Jot is one of several ways to make iced coffee I've tried lately, and it's the only one that's good enough to make a dent in my coffee shop purchases. The flavor is great--strong but not bitter. And despite being very concentrated, the texture isn't syrupy, which makes it easy to dilute. When I go back to work in the office, it'll be much easier to take along a bottle of Jot than a 48 oz. jug of iced coffee.",5
4024,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/13/2021,"I was excited after reading about you product in a review. I thought this would be a great way to ditch the Keurig and go with Jot. I’m a hot dark roast black coffee drinker and the cold brew I buy occasionally is Starbuck’s Nitro cold brew. 
After receiving your product, I heated the prescribed 8oz of water and added the 1 T of Jot. Upon tasting, I found it to be slightly bitter and to me really didn’t taste like the dark roasted coffee I have enjoyed. 
I made it several times after that hoping my taste buds were wrong. 
I really wanted to like it but sadly I won’t be ordering this again. 
I wish you every success for your product.

4026,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/13/2021,"I kept seeing Jot on my Facebook feed and after a while, decided to finally try it. Needless to say, it is quite delicious. Nice armor and coffee flavor. None of that burnt taste that I usually get from my k-cups. I think that Jot coffee is definitely worth a try if you're a coffee lover!",5
4027,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/13/2021,Better than I thought it would be!,5
4028,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/13/2021,"My husband and I are about halfway through our second bottle of JOT and we love it! Bold, rich flavor and no weird aftertaste like some of the other coffee concentrates. We’re recommending this to all our friends!",5
4029,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/13/2021,"This coffee is so convenient and easy to make in the morning and it keeps me going all day! My only tiny complaint is i wish it could have a bit more coffee flavor, once you’ve added the milk/water, the coffee flavor is mostly gone.",4
4030,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/13/2021,"It’s not bad, but I really like a strong cold brew and this is too mild when mixed as directed. I’ll try making it stronger but then it obviously won’t be as cost effective",3
4031,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/13/2021,"I thought that it was pretty good. Very smooth tasting. The only complaint I had was that I thought it was going to be stronger then it was. I like a nice dark, strong coffee. This really isn't that. Still good though.",4
4032,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/13/2021,The coffee is delicious! Just as good as a coffee shop latte but far more convenient for workdays!,5
4033,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/13/2021,For 14 servings per bottle it’s worth the time saved dealing with coffee ground and giant mason jars when making cold brew for 10-12hrs…. Not to mention the instant access.,5
4034,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/13/2021,"This is the best tasting coffee I’ve tried in a long time. Since it’s been so hot, cold coffee if perfect on a hot day. It’s even better that I don’t have to deal with grounds, or straining or even the wait. 
I’ll be keeping this on hand for my daily coffee experience.",5

4037,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/12/2021,I love cold brew concentrate and I tried making my own but it wasn’t quite as good as what I could buy. Jot was truly revolutionary for me! It’s great with water or oat milk!,5
4038,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/12/2021,"I was skeptical regarding this product and I am happy to say, i am glad that I purchased this coffee. I kept it simple for my first cup. I poured cold milk and added this delicious concentration and the end result is smooth. It tastes better than my regular pour over coffee. Great job.",5
4039,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/12/2021,I like it and its more convenient to use than a Keurig. Now I feel like i'm just using my Keurig for the hot water Ill use with my Jot bottles.,5

Will absolutely shop here again!",5
4042,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/12/2021,"This is my new addiction! So quick and easy to make and tastes so delicious! My boyfriend might be more addicted than me. He has at least two cups a day. We do it iced, with sweetened condensed milk. Love at first sip! I went ahead and started our subscription because we can't imagine going without.",5
4043,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/12/2021,"I rarely drink coffee. If I need caffeine, I drink energy tea drinks and when I do drink coffee, it's usually an iced caramel macchiato from Starbucks. So, being pretty far from a coffee expert or lover, I was skeptical if this would be worth for me. Admittedly, it took a few sips for me to get used to it, but now I'm actually craving it! My parents are also skeptical of online food products and are every day coffee drinkers and they absolutely love this.",5
4044,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/12/2021,I love the ease of pouring an iced cup of coffee from a little teaspoon and adding milk instead of the long process of actually making iced coffee at home!,5
4045,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/12/2021,"Great taste and super versatile. Love it with water over ice, no sugar or cream needed.",5
4046,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/12/2021,It is good but a little expensive for what you get. For a normal coffee drinker it does not make 14 cups per bottle. Closer to 8.,4

4048,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/12/2021,The flavor was smooth and I truly enjoy the caramel undertones. It was a delicious cup of coffee for sure! It was super easy to mix up and a lot quicker than either my Keurig or drip coffee maker!,5
4049,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/12/2021,"I love Jot! I’m a big coffee drinker, at home I always have cold brew, coffee for french press and my espresso machine. Obviously none of these are practical for work and I wanted good coffee without having to stop at a coffee shop or carry my tumbler to work. In comes Jot! So easy to make, delicious and so practical to keep a bottle on hand.",5
4050,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/12/2021,I tried this on a whim and I'm really happy I did. My first cup yesterday was as an unsweetened almond milk iced latte and it was excellent. My next will be black iced coffee today. No bite to it at all. My 13 year old daughter loves it as well and we're recommending it to family and friends. Really delicious and I love the pretty new glasses you sent me. Thank you!,5
4051,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/12/2021,Its a great product to streamline my mornings.,5

4055,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/12/2021,First time trying jot with iced water and the taste was very sour. Contacted customer service and they were kind enough to send me a replacement. I was unable to find the expiration date and lot # on the bottle. I tried the same bottle with almond milk and there is no sour taste and was a lot better than with water.overall this product is super convenient way to make a cup of coffee,3
4056,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/12/2021,This us very good coffee and so convenient to make. Highly recommended.,5

4062,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/12/2021,Honestly this is just so good and convenient,5
4063,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/12/2021,"I was expecting something fairly boring, think cold brew but with less flavor. I was pleasantly surprised when my cup of coffee kept me going back for another sip. As someone who prefers his coffee bitter but milky, cold brew often doesn't interest me because adding milk to it somehow just makes it lose a lot of flavor. Not the case here, and I'll likely be drinking Jot coffee for the foreseeable future!",5
4064,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/12/2021,"I am thrilled with my recent purchase. As someone who only drinks their coffee iced, this is a wonderful and easy way to ensure I always have a cold coffee that taste great.",5
4065,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/12/2021,I love a good iced coffee or vanilla latte but don’t like taking the time to make a shot or two using other slower methods. Jot is super easy and tastes awesome! I am almost through my first bottle and have loved every glass!,5

Then I tried it with oat milk along with oat milk creamer, and it’s my favorite coffee/latte I’ve ever had. My go to is 2 Tbsp Jot, 24 Tbsp oat milk, and 6 Tbsp oat milk oatmeal creamer. Try it. Thank me later!",5
4068,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/12/2021,Product is fabulous! But I think the way it’s sent could be better. As a flight attendant I need a portable option. So having one large bottle that needs to be refrigerated after opening is difficult. I’d love single use pods that I can throw in my bag and travel with!,4
4069,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/12/2021,It’s everything I want instant coffee to be plus the caffeine content and low acidity of cold brew. Jot is the next step in the technological progression of coffee in our time.,5
4070,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/12/2021,Jot makes the perfect iced coffee for the summer! It’s smooth flavor holds up well too I’ve and a splash of crab and it’s soo easy to make. It’s good stuff!,5

It is super strong for only a tablespoon, but it is really smooth and it smells incredible. I mix it with almond milk and a splash of vanilla creamer over ice and it is honestly perfection. I may not even stock up on my bagged ground coffee anymore, especially since I never drink hot coffee! 10/10",5
4073,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/12/2021,The coffee is super easy to make and tastes wonderful. I and my wife really love the glasses too!,5

I saw the ad for Jot and decided to give it a try. My first glass I used about 6 oz of oat milk, 1 oz of water and a splash of vanilla sweetener. It was AMAZING! The coffee flavor was just as strong as a latte and the pick me up was perfect. Definitely going to keep ordering Jot!",5
4081,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/11/2021,Have been enjoying since delivery!,5
4082,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/11/2021,"So… I tried Jot on a whim… because, honestly, there’s no way it could be convenience AND good, right? Wrong. I am in love. Jot has completely replaced my coffee pot routine. Hot or iced… I cannot recommend this product highly enough.",5
4083,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee Extra Bottle (14 Cups),07/11/2021,I randomly came across Jot while online and thought why not? I mix one tablespoon with a glass of almond milk and a touch of vanilla creamer. No sugar. My 18 year old son loves it also. It's so easy and quick and tastes delicious! Imagine being able to make a great cup of cold coffee in seconds in your home!!,5

4086,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/11/2021,"I am a little extra with my coffee - I don’t wanna call myself a snob but, like, I am *particular*. I make my own cold brew, espresso drinks, etc - and I usually hate any prepared coffee drinks. I just had a baby though and don’t have the time or energy to make myself my boujee drinks right now. I found jot and decided to give it a try. 

Amazing. 

Super concentrated, none if that weak watered down nonsense. But it’s smooth and not at all bitter. It really does only take a TBSP to make a really delicious, strong and flavorful cup of coffee. I pour it over ice, one pump of simple syrup, a splash of water and some oat milk and it’s perfection. Takes about 45 seconds and it’s better than most iced coffees I’d buy in a shop. Definitely recommend.",5
4087,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/11/2021,Honestly this tasted just like the instant coffee packs that we would get in MREs in the army. Pros would definitely be convenience not much more. I had two cups on the first go and fell back asleep so the caffeine buzz is kind of a joke. Best part was that it came with two free cups that I honestly like better than the coffee,3
4088,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/11/2021,It’s so easy and fast and taste so good!!!!,5
4089,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/11/2021,A little disappointed in the taste. Pretty similar to instant coffee.,3

4091,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/11/2021,I was making my own cold brew for months and going through SO MUCH coffee. This is heaps easier and is just as good as my home brewed. I’m obsessed and will be telling all the coffee drinkers I know about it. Also the glasses are v cute.,5
4092,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/11/2021,Love it! It’s so good I’m already ordering more just to be sure I don’t run out. Much cheaper and faster than going to coffee shop.,5
4093,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/11/2021,It is good. I’m impressed. I use a little sugar free syrup with some plant based creamer and add ice,5
4094,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/11/2021,"If you frequent coffee shops for your dose of morning fix, this is a must! It tastes great and the caffeine gives you a nice jolt. I’m a mom of two who is always rushing to get out the door every morning. Jot makes it so easy to make my morning coffee without spending a lot of time making it or stopping by the coffee shop. 

I hope in the near future they come up with a refill/recycling program because I’ll be a long time customer!",5

4099,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/11/2021,"Honestly the easiest way to joltstart my morning. Spoon of jot over ice in a glass, fill with almond milk. Way cheaper than SBUX, and it actually tastes really good, no sour taste that espresso can sometimes have.",5
4100,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/11/2021,"Move over big box coffee! The little powerhouse is here. Jot clean,rich flavor. Easy to use and super satisfying. The perfect replacement for the trip to the coffee shop.",5

4117,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/11/2021,"Dear Andrew,
Where do I start? I was introduced to Jot by my daughter, who, like me, loves speciality coffees.. Especially cold brews. 
 
I would not have believed that such a smooth , rich , full bodied coffee was possible out if a concentrate unless I had tried it .

At first taste.. I was blown away.. absolutely. This coffee tastes amazing.. just mixed with water and ice.. but then…. Add creamer and cold foam and BAM!!! Nirvana.. without losing any coffee integrity.
Good coffee.. no.. amazing coffee.. easy.. no mess.. no gadgets.. no fuss.. just Taste!

I’m a believer!

4118,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/11/2021,"Taste is really good. Only thing I’d say negative is that the price seems a little high but considering how many coffees you can make per bottle I guess it’s not too bad. I’d definitely buy again also really enjoyed the free glasses you guys provided maybe do something similar in the future. That’s actually what pushed me towards buying the coffee, i love free stuff.",5

I'm not a great ""barista"", so I don't really make traditional coffee drinks. My go to right now is using it in my protein shake and adding some to my water bottle when I'm on the go. I really appreciate the versatility of Jot for making that possible while simplifying my caffeine routine",5

The coffee packs flavors and it’s easy to make iced coffee (which is my husband and I’d preferred method of coffee making / drinking during the hot and humid Summers in Savannah). The packaging is wonderful and reminds us of ink blots and our rabbit, Murphy. It shipped quickly and was all carefully wrapped so nothing was broken in transit. I appreciate that no plastics were used in shipping, and it could be broken down and recycled or reused. I’d love to purchase again!",5

I’m currently in the military and in tech school. The coffee is horrible here so I needed something that allowed me to sip on my coffee while doing labs & homework. I’m a happy camper with your product & willing to subscribe for the long run if I could find a steady affordable price once I sign up for more than one shipment. Overall I’m glad there is a company that is using social media to attract customers like myself that love quality coffee. 

Thank you

I don’t like pod coffee so have been doing pour over for years. I prefer iced coffee, and better yet cold brew, but always found the at-home process for making them too much work to mod consistently. Jot is not only easy but it’s distinctly better and far more consistent than any other method I’ve tried before. I’m so happy I found it and can’t wait to experiment with different drinks. I made the mistake of getting a Starbucks while out an about today and confirmed just how much better Jot is. There’s a no going back for me.",5

Personally, I don't even use a spoon -- I just count out 2-3 seconds and it's good for me because I like it strong and black. Very nice on these hot summer days. I've put away my Nespresso machine and just drink this 2-3 times a day.",5

I hate coffee filters. I hate cleaning a coffee maker. I hate hot coffee in the summer.

The coffee itself is super versatile in that you can mix it with milk, water or whatever else you can think of (though I’ve only tried it with milk and water).

4209,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/08/2021,"The flavor of Jot is so good, and it couldn’t be easier to drop a tablespoon into iced water. The bottle feels so luxurious, I look forward to making a cup in the morning!",5

4211,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/07/2021,"Very good quality concentrate, it mixes well and without any inconsistency almost instantly. Would buy again, planning on developing a few recipes around this for my baking business as the strong flavor could lend to a few desserts that need that extra boost in richness and flavor.",5
4212,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/07/2021,I bought this on a whim and I’m so impressed. It’s so convenient not having to wait for cold brew to steep for 24 hours. It’s also delicious and really versatile. You can add it to anything. Highly recommend!,5
4213,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/07/2021,"for someone who likes his coffee dark and strong I found the first jot to be very similar. in a rush, this is my go to. i enjoy it on ice more so. the glasses were a nice bonus",4
4214,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/07/2021,"Loved the attention to detail, from the packing to even the small bottles the coffee’s were stored in. Everything is very high quality. One downside of this was the fact that i personally did not get 14 cups of coffee out of my 1 bottle. This could’ve been my own mistake as well. Would love to see how the next 2 bottles go.",4
4215,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/07/2021,I love Jot coffee. Will be ordering more.,5

4217,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/07/2021,"I mix mine with water and add the liquid Delight , zero sugar French vanilla and it taste better than what I was getting at Starbucks! I put the plastic frozen ice cubes in it so it won’t water down. Stays cold!",5

4219,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/07/2021,I was surprised by how fast I could make coffee in the morning by using Jot. The speed at which I can move onto my next morning task is very motivating and I feel myself being productive haha. The taste is refreshing and I'm very impressed. The only down part is that I got the double Jot bundle with the 2 glass mugs and I was hoping to also receive the spoon but it wasn't included. Just a heads up since I couldn't find it on their website :),5
4220,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/07/2021,"Probably thinking ""yeah right, perfect??"" Yes I said it. It's perfect! I have worked at multiple coffee shops and each one is unique. I love Jot for how simple and tasty it is.",5
4221,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/07/2021,Ordered this on a whim and it did not disappoint! One of the smoother coffees I’ve had and just the right strength. Will definitely order again!,5
4222,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/07/2021,"So far, I’m liking the product! It’s super quick and easy to fix a tall glass of refreshing iced coffee! During the summer, it’s much better to sit on our patio with an iced coffee vs a hot cup of joe! Im enjoying this! Going to have to look at different recipes for other varieties of iced coffees!!",5
4223,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/07/2021,"Absolutely love, Starbucks is no longer needed! First time I made it I mixed in with milk, was a little too “rich”. Have been mixing with sweetened condensed milk and water and the combination is perfection. Even my 14 year old die hard Starbucks fan prefers it.",5
4224,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/07/2021,Amazing coffee! It’s a must try…once you do you too will be hooked.,5
4225,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/07/2021,Making a cup of coffee in the morning no longer feels like a chore with Jot. It honestly does not get easier than mixing coffee and water together to get a good cup of coffee every time. I do find that i need to a add just a bit more than 1 tbs to my 8oz of water since u like my coffee to taste stronger.,5
4226,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/07/2021,"Really enjoy the stuff, have a cup every morning!",5
4227,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/07/2021,"I am a nurse and newly a father. I love cold brew and have a tough time finding the time to make my own cold brew. Jot has made this so much easier for me! A quick pour of some water, cream and some Jot and I’m ready to head out the door! It tastes great and super convenient",5
4228,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/07/2021,"I was very skeptical if this would taste any good, and it was surprisingly good! I'll get more for sure.",5
4229,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/07/2021,I saw a lot of “influencers” sharing Jot on their pages and decided to give it a try to save myself from so many trips to Starbucks. Immediately loved it and haven’t looked back. I mix mine with either almond milk or vanilla protein every morning and make my homemade latte. I don’t miss my Starbucks at all. Well worth the price and the bottle design is sleek. Plus for being environmentally friendly as well.,5
4230,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/07/2021,"Not gonna lie, I saw a couple ads of Jot before finally taking the plunge. I am a sucker for a good deal and when they had the two free cups offer, I had to try it out. I purchased the spoon with the 2 bottles and as soon as it was delivered, I had to make a cup. Very potent and has a delicious and smooth taste! Ridiculously tasty and only added some cream as that's my preference when drinking my coffee. I've already recommended this stuff to my friends and and even make them a cup as soon as they come to my house! Will absolutely purchase again and continue to spread the word - very thankful to have more time in my morning and excited to try more variations with Jot in the future.",5
4231,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/07/2021,Use Jot mainly for ice coffees. It has a good taste and is easy to prepare. Will definitely repurchase for convenience over the summer.,4
4232,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/06/2021,"I work at a hospital, FREE coffee at work doesn’t really taste good. So I brought my JOT with me and easy as 1 jot spoon I can always enjoy easy fancy taste coffee.
I am subscribed!!",5
4233,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/06/2021,"OMG this is the best coffee I have ever tried in my life…. If you want a Starbucks experience at home well this is the one. My kids love it, I love it, all the family loves it….. will be buying again",5

4235,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/06/2021,I was skeptical. I am converted. The ease mixed with the taste = tasty tasty.,5
4236,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/06/2021,"The coffee was robust, low acidity, and packed a punch. I will definitely order again.",5
4237,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/06/2021,So far the best concentrate I have had! Love it iced with almond milk and creamer. So fast to make in the morning. Told my coworkers about Jot too!,5
4238,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/06/2021,"The coffee is super fast and easy to make. There is a slight sour aftertaste that comes with it, but it’s bearable. 8/10.",4
4239,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/06/2021,"I was worried it was going to be too strong, but it's just right! I've tried so many of the coffee service things and a bunch of brands of iced coffee, as well as making my own cold brew. This is the best by far.",5
4240,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/06/2021,I’ve seen Jot coffee on my Instagram feed for many years. I decided to pull the trigger and order some. I truly enjoy the product and can’t wait for more.,5
4241,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/06/2021,"I ordered my second package recently after my daughter managed to “share” half of my first order. She even mentioned that I could drop ship bottles to her monthly when she heads off to college in a few weeks. How nice of her! :) Really enjoying JOT and don’t mind saving quite a few $ as well. PS: Mixed with Oat Milk, this is a fantastic, refreshing drink!",5
4242,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/06/2021,I have tried multiple brands of coffee and this one is the best I have had.,5

4244,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/06/2021,"really loving this stuff. I work overnights and drink it as a snack: because it has such good flavor, I usually put a tbsp over ice with a splash of coffee creamer, and then just sip it. it's the perfect, little jo(l)t and it doesn't fill you up!",5
4245,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/06/2021,"I was very skeptical as im not usually one for ""instant"" coffee but I really enjoy jot! I drink it everyday now!",5
4246,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/06/2021,I bought the double coffee pack with the glass mugs. I also added the spoon. The packaging and design was on point. Loved the attention to detail. The mugs are solid and have a nice bevel at the lip. The spoon was nice but I felt fell short with the material. I was able to easily bend it and it felt a bit flimsy. Other than that the coffees on the go or on a pinch for time have been great. Recently brought it on a road trip and has been a nice upgrade to my morning coffee.,4
4247,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/06/2021,"I am a medical professional who works crazy hours and sometimes just wants to sleep in when I can, jot is great because I just pour it in add water and cream and go. So simple and so great!",5

4251,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/06/2021,I was spending way too much money on getting coffee from my local shops everyday and this totally beats that the flavor is super smooth and delicious it’s totally worth it!,5
4252,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/06/2021,"I was so excited to try this coffee as someone who hates the usual pot of coffee in the morning. The bottles came with a little recipe card and they were SO delicious- the shaken brown sugar was my favorite. I do think the price is a bit steep considering each bottle only has 14tbsp, but hey I’ve spent a lot more on a lot less.",4
4253,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/06/2021,"The flavor is rich, deep and lovely. It goes well with my oat milk and little flavoring (although not necessary). It’s as easy as pouring over your preferred mix of water and milk and you’re set. Will buy again.",5
4254,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/06/2021,im a big fan of iced coffees and jot just nailed it! love how smooth my iced coffees in the morning! and i love the jot packaging!,5

I always order an Iced caramel latte at Starbucks or Paris Baguette, now I can make my own at home.
I’m so glad I tried and purchased Jot coffee, I’m almost done with my first bottle and definitely be ordering more!",5
4256,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/06/2021,Really enjoying the convenience and ease of use. So simple to make a multitude of coffee drinks with the one product in literally minutes. Such an upgrade from what I was doing previously and the taste and quality are phenomenal.,5

4259,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/06/2021,JOT is amazing!! My new favorite .,5
4260,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/06/2021,"I’m a coffee snob, esp cold brew. I look for 1 ingredient in my cold brew which is organic coffee and that is it. Very few companies make good tasting, smooth, organic cold brew with no other ingredients. I love that Jot is a concentrate which takes up little space for storage and is easily mixed with milk or water. By far the best tasting, smoothest cold brew I’ve tried yet. No jitters after drinking either!",5
4261,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/05/2021,"Very good, got my husband hooked too!",5
4262,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/05/2021,"Such good coffee with an amazing taste. Also, such a convenient way to make a delicious cup of coffee with a busy schedule.",5
4263,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/05/2021,"At first I thought this was just another Tik Tok/Instagram scam so influencers could make money. However this is one of the few 'influenced' brands that I have taken a leap of faith for and not regretted it. Jot tastes really good and is super convenient but it doesn't upset my stomach or make me too jittery like other brands. And, of course, always loving the plastic-free bottles and shipping! It would be cool for customers to be able to send back the empty glass bottles for a small discount on their next purchase. Only slight downside is that if you like super strong tasting coffee like me you might have to add just a liiiiittle more Jot, but not much. And it's still cheaper and less human interaction than Starbucks.",4
4264,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/05/2021,I love how quick it is to mix up a cold cup of coffee in the morning. It gets me pumped and keeps me energized AND it tastes great!,5
4265,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/05/2021,"Great tasting, easy to prepare, tastes great with milk or black. Even better as a drizzle on vanilla ice cream. Will definitely be trying more applications!",5
4266,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/05/2021,"Amazing. So much smoother than traditional iced coffee, and zero bitterness like most cold brew options out there. Not to mention the cost per serving is a fraction of your average corporate coffee chain",5
4267,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/05/2021,"I use it mostly for ice coffee, and it was so easy. Jot coffee makes a great ice coffee. Haven't tried it hot yet",5
4268,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/05/2021,"When i 1st saw this, i was like hmmm...how could this turn out to be a good cup of coffee... My 1st cup was over ice w/ cold water w/ condensed milk. it was so so until the milk finally melted. i then realized it is harder to dissolve condensed sweetened milk in cold ice water than hot. The coffee went in a little plain, then as it goes down it's pretty good. more flavor. I tried it today HOT, and it's pretty good!! Better than i expected. The only downside is i wish there was a longer shelf life. it says should be consumed w/in 2 to 3 weeks after opening. Very cute glasses too! Thank u!",4

They even give you recipes and I tried it all to see which I like best. The only reason I’d buy coffee at a coffee shop is because I ran out of Jot.",5
4272,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/05/2021,"I love iced coffee. After finding a remote job, I bought a Nespresso coffee maker and tried to make both hot and iced coffee with it. It did not satisfy my cravings for iced coffee, and I didn’t want to spend any more money than I have at Starbucks. Then, I discovered Jot. I decided to try it and I was blown away by all the flavor profiles and combinations you can make with Jot, all with a simple tablespoon of it. It tastes smooth and satisfies my ice coffee cravings! I love it :)",5
4273,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/05/2021,I am obsessed with Jot. I have had a glass of cold brew every morning since I received it! Customer for life. I mix it in water and top it off with some creamer and boom that’s it!,5

4276,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/05/2021,"So many of these companies offer “premium” coffee for a low price but fail to deliver on the “premium” part of the experience. I’ve had a cup of Jot every day since my order arrived and I’m about to make another after I finish this review. It really is worth it, the clean packaging, nice glass bottles, and perfect serving spoon make the experience easy and smooth, just like the coffee itself. I’ll be ordering two more bottles with no hesitation whatsoever. Also trying to get my friends to try it out too! To put it short: order this coffee, you won’t regret it.",5
4277,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/05/2021,Jot is one of the best iced coffee I have ever made at home. My 17 year old son wanted to try it and said you better buy some more of this because I don't want to quit drinking it. I will definitely buy more. My only complaint was I ordered the spoon as well and it didn't come but I didn't need it to make the best cup of coffee,5
4278,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/05/2021,"I kept seeing ads for Jot coffee and finally caved in. When my package arrived, I was really impressed with how well they were packaged.

Not only was it super easy to make, it was sooooooooooo good and the concentrate packed soo much flavor.

4285,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/05/2021,At first I was skeptical but once I got the Jot and tried it I’m a believer. It’s tasty and smooth.,5
4286,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/05/2021,"I used to make a cup of coffee, let it cool and the poor it over ice. This is exactly what I was looking for. Quick, easy and tastes like an iced americano. One tablespoon over ice water and a dab of condensed milk is just about perfect for me. Now I just need to order the tablespoon to make it that much easier.",5
4287,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/05/2021,I like that you can follow the suggested directions or adjust the amount of concentrate for suit your taste.,5

4289,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/05/2021,I like the ease of making coffee this way. It has a strong flavor though so if you don’t like black coffee it’s defiantly needs creamer. Reminds me of nitro cold brew from Starbucks. Will be ordering more!,4
4290,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/05/2021,Jot provides an easy and very satisfying cup of coffee without the mess and long process of making my own cold brew which I have been doing for years. I am a fan!,5

4296,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/05/2021,"My first cup of jot wasn’t my favorite cup of coffee. I am someone who likes it strong and I really didn’t get the strong coffee taste. However, i felt like it got better towards the bottom of the jot container. Maybe it just needs to be shaken. If so, it’s not bad for the price. It’ll definitely be something I keep in my coffee repertoire, especially when guests come to town.",3
4297,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/05/2021,But oh boy am I glad they did! This is so easy to throw together in the morning before dashing out the door & it tastes good too!,5

So I decided to try this and I love it. I don’t think I’ll be going back. It’s so smooth! I’ll mix it with water when I run out of milk for a mocha and just some simple syrup. It’s so good.

4414,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,06/28/2021,"The order came on time, coffee tasted surprisingly good. I love Thai coffee, so I use sweeten condensed milk it was delicious. I tried it with just heavy cream and no sweetener… It was delicious. If you’re on the fence about trying it, try it… It’s surprisingly good.",5

So much so, we set out to convince any coffee drinkers we know (and that's a lot) that this is not your average ""instant coffee."" It tastes so refreshingly smooth - no bitterness like you'd get with normal coffee, but at the same time, it TASTES like coffee - not WATER or an off flavor like you get with other instant coffees. We bought a second bottle before we ran out of the first! We are Jot believers for sure!",5

I tend to be one for a time-saving hack and this is it- I use 1/2 a bottle (8 tablespoons) to make 2 quarts of the coffee and I keep it in my fridge, ready to go for the following week or two.",5

4433,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,06/26/2021,"I love the convenience of this product as much as I love the taste. I drink my coffee iced with no cream or sweetener so the base flavor is important to me and Jot hits the flavor mark with perfection. As well, I really appreciate that I don't have to store a huge pitcherof coffee in the fridge, or on the counter, and it's an easy ""on-demand"" thing to make a cup. I love the ease of making a coffee mid morning at the office, or right out of the gym. Also I took a bottle of Jot camping this week and will now be including a bottle in my camping kit in the future, so easy and hassle free without taking up too much space or adding extra weight.",4

4438,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,06/25/2021,"I was struggling between Jot & Javy on which #SuperCoffee to try-out.
Decided to research reviews of customers videos on YouTube & Instagram and it was obvious the choice was JOT for flavor & quality so I took the plunge and subscribed for a deeper discount on my first two bottles! Well two weeks later I’m out and needed more ASAP (not a nice person when I don’t have my coffee) so I upped my subscription to three bottles every two weeks, mind you it’s for wifey & me.
I didn’t know what to expect from a #SuperCoffee #MicroDose coffee subscription but now I’m a customer as long as JOT customer service team lives up to their part. Forgot to mention we’re kinda coffee snobs who enjoy gourmet fresh roasted beans from our local coffee roaster. We have traveled across the country visiting different coffee roasters to experience the joy of coffee. I’m sure my wife is happy my monthly coffee shop bill is being lowered by trying JOT!
The flavor is rich with a smokey kinda nutty flavor which suits me fine, I’m a Breve’ latte kinda guy who loves hot coffee but I’ve been pleasantly surprised by going iced-coffee with JOT & Califia Farms barista blend Oat milk, Just One Tablespoon to 8-12oz. Oat milk is my go to.

It's super simple and quick to make, so far I've made iced and normal lattes and just a straight up black coffee.

I immediately subscribed once I finished my first cup. Jot is great as an americano or as a plain old cold brew. There is not a trace of bitterness, just delicious, smooth, aromatic, excellent coffee. I love it with cold coconut milk and a dash of oat milk over ice. 14/10 would recommend.",5

4462,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee Extra Bottle (14 Cups),06/24/2021,"Jot is exceptional. I am pretty picky when it comes to coffee so after my first glass of coffee using jot, I was very giddy. The style of the bottle is just COOL and the taste is spot on (not like burnt roasted coffee beans ). Plus, the serving size is so worth it. I used to buy coffee regularly but one bottle lasts me 2-3 weeks! Not to mention the recipe card Jot gives in their box, so SO cool! I can't wait to get my hands on some of their sick glasses!",5

4465,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,06/23/2021,"There's been some issues with consistency in taste. My first order was great and the coffee had a smooth, dark rich taste when just simply mixed with water. My second order the coffee tastes a lot more bitter I need to add milk to it.",3
4466,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,06/23/2021,"I'm not really a 5 star kind of person, if something meets expectations it's 4 stars and it needs to be something exceptional to 5. That said, Jot really blew me away. I'm not a big coffee flavor person, I can't taste the difference between different beans or roasts, other than if I like it or not. I've never liked hot coffee or iced coffee because it was still too bitter or acidic (I can't even tell which!) for me to really enjoy, so I had always opted for cold brew. 

Making my own cold brew was okay, but between grinding the beans, letting it sit, trying to filter it, it was too much work for me to do regularly, and made it a lot harder for me to just have a cup of coffee without at least a day of lead time. 

So far Jot is solving all of that. I went in expecting something closer to a strong tasting iced coffee and was prepared to suffer through it. Instead what I got was a very smooth, and tasty, coffee concentrate. The first glass I mixed with some vanilla soy milk and it was great, normally I would need to add a lot of sweetener to be able to enjoy coffee but with Jot I need almost no additional sweetener.

I would definitely try it if you're at all interested, especially since there are usually deals or discounts.",5
4467,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,06/23/2021,"Open the jar and just smell the wonderful bouquet! After a few adjustments this was my perfect cup of morning coffee. I love that its shelf stable, at least until opened, since I have limited cold storage and need my coffee in the am. Glad I gave this a try and am ready to order more!",5
4468,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee Extra Bottle (14 Cups),06/23/2021,This stuff is amazing and lightning fast to whip up amazing iced coffees! My budget is going to have a boost with all the iced coffee I buy when I’m out that I will no longer need!,5
4469,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,06/23/2021,Couldn’t be more convenient and delicious. Jot is a real game changer for me. Never looking back!,5
4470,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,06/23/2021,It makes a great alternative to buying coffees at the stand. I use it as a shot substitute and add cream with sweetener and it’s just as good if not better then buying one at the coffee stand because you don’t have to leave your house!,5
4471,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,06/22/2021,Love the flavor and the convenience.,5

4478,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee Extra Bottle (14 Cups),06/21/2021,"Finally got a chance to try my Jot. I specifically got Jot to make iced mochas as my partner and I love them. I'm not a chemist, not even a good cook, so, yes, making an iced mocha is a huge challenge. So, this morning, I tried my first attempt and it wasn't bad. Still need to tweak the amounts of Jot, chocolate syrup and milk, but I took the first step. I would love it if you guys would put out a recipe book of coffee drinks. I looked at the two that were included in my box, and appreciate it, but not my style. Just a suggestion. I'm a fan so far. I'm not a huge coffee drinker, but I do like my iced mochas in the summertime and hot ones in the winter. Thanks for popping up on my screen and peaking my interest.",5

4485,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,06/21/2021,"I like iced coffee and thought this would be an easier way to make it cold without putting my hot coffee on ice and watering it down. I also like the fact that I can make it as strong or as weak as I want to, one cup at a time. 
It has a good flavor, the only concern I have is that it tends to settle (?) and stick to the bottle and when I shake the bottle to dislodge that, it makes what looks like coffee grounds in it.",5

4488,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,06/21/2021,This is a really convenient way to make coffee. One tablespoon is really enough for a small cup. It doesn’t make me jittery like some coffee concentrates in the past have. I am going to continue to buy for now.,4

However—Jot has changed my perspective on buying out! I love how small yet insanely concentrated one single spoon is.

I would get a triple espresso with light almond milk and three pumps of sugar-free vanilla syrup. The parking lot was always crowded and very rarely did they get my order correct. So I decided to try Jott.
I start my morning by preparing it super quick and exactly how I want it and now I am bypassing the crazy parking lot and my bank account is much happier with the choice to change over to jot my triple espresso is a thing of the past as I use 2 tablespoons of Jott in about 12 ounces of water and it’s fantastic.

4569,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,06/13/2021,Slightly disappointed that the bottle only lasts me 4 days. I waste more trying to get my coffee to taste like coffee and to taste bold. But it just seems to taste watered down each time. Typically I buy $5 cold brew pints which on average lasts me 7 days and has bold flavor out the bottle. I really wanted to enjoy this product but it was just meh.,3

4577,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,06/12/2021,my husband and I are HOOKED!,5
4578,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,06/12/2021,"I opted to give Jot coffee a try based on the advice from a YouTube influencer and I'm glad I did. I was impressed with how Jot uses corked glass bottles to hold their precious java juice and I have a few ideas already running through my head on how to upcycle them. 

Note to Jot: make and include/sell a cork remover so we can clean and upcycle the bottles. I'm currently using a crochet hook and that works, but it's not the easiest thing to do... and who wants a bent hook?

I usually drink my coffee traditionally, hot with a splash of cream (no sugar) and my first cup of Jot was very enjoyable. Flavor was bold, not bitter tasting, and I could tell I was getting a quality cup of coffee. I ripped through my first bottle in a few days and quickly realized that I'd have to control myself if I wanted my coffee to last until the next shipment. I have started taking a Jot coffee after dinner and it's something I've come to look forward to.

I also tried Jot coffee as a cold drink. I mixed 1 tbsp of Jot with 8 oz unsweetened almond milk and 10 drops of Sweet Drops Stevia sweetener and it was delicious! 

This is simply a great, convenient way to get a quality cup of coffee. I'm hooked!",5

4587,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,06/11/2021,I was skeptical but I’m so happy I did it. I usually drink coffee with lots of milk and pump or two of something sweet.

4588,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,06/11/2021,I wasn’t sure what to expect from this coffee. I tried it more for the aesthetics and it tastes amazing! I like mine with oat milk and ice. Wonderful way to cut down time during mornings when I’m rushing.,5

Flavor isn’t there, it’s weak or it’s strong and overly difficult to get to any happy medium. I am elated over the fact that finally a product has seemingly broken the coffee mold. Jot has not only produced an extraordinary product but they have made it amazingly no fuss and easy to get just right. I love everything from the packaging to the wonderful flavor and versatility. Jot delivers on all claims and it’s just an exceptional cup of coffee either hot or iced. I love it and find my self having an extra cup because it’s so good. The price point is also unbeatable.

It has the good, strong taste of cold brew but doesn't waste so much coffee grinds. It is a little pricey considering I need to make at least two cups, but it is definitely strong enough to mix with 10oz of water instead of 8.

With the wonderful strong coffee flavor provided by Jot, you don’t have to sacrifice the luxurious texture of the milks with watered down coffee or espresso. The coconut oil takes the health benefits to the next level. This drink is the best of all worlds, flavor, texture and health with no compromises!",5

4729,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/27/2021,"This coffee has changed my morning routine completely and has saved me time and money. I can make a delicious tasting coffee, know exactly what goes in it, not have to wait in long lines in my car for half the price of going and getting a coffee from a stand/shop. I've hooked my hubs on it too. I've tried another company's concentrated coffee before and it had a bitter taste to it. Jot doesn't have the burnt bitter taste to it and it makes my coffee drink super tasty! Will be sticking with Jot from now on!",5

4737,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/25/2021,I enjoy making my coffee quickly before work. It's delicious! My only complaint is it can be slightly acidic. I'd also love a recipe book for ratios for different types of coffees and syrups!,4
4738,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/25/2021,"I work nights and this coffee is very convenient. It is very yummy and easy to make at any time. Also, it keeps me awake!",5

I like a tall glass of ice and a Carmel Priemer Protein drink 🥤 two tablespoons of Jot and BAM 💥 my intentions are set for the day! Breakfast is served! And this is high quality coffee!

 I am looking forward to trying the new flavor!",5

4742,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/24/2021,"Absolutely love this product. My favorite is making it into a cold brew, easy measuring and just add iced water.

4744,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/24/2021,"I wasn’t sure if I would like the taste of Jot... but I was SO wrong. This is an amazing alternative to Starbucks, Dunkin’, whatever your preference is. The flavor is smooth, balanced and mixes amazing with regular milk, oat milk, almond milk, you name it! My husband even likes it and he’s a coffee snob!",5
4745,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/24/2021,I love being able to simply add jot to a glass of iced water and have my coffee ready to go! No waiting or preparing beforehand! The coffee tastes amazing and is so smooth. This is exactly what I needed to make my mornings easier and tastier!,5
4746,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/24/2021,I still prefer brewed coffee in the morning but love Jot for iced coffee every afternoon,5
4747,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/24/2021,Convenient and quick coffee with that coffee shop flavor.. yummm,5
4748,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/24/2021,"I rarely take the time to write a review, but I actually wrote into the concierge to let them know that this is the best, most flavorful coffee I have ever had, either hot or cold from any establishment - EVER! I even ordered an alternative concentrated coffee because it was a bit cheaper, and I was sorely disappointed in the flavor. Jot is definitely more per serving, but the flavor just doesn’t compare. Jot is the epitome of premium coffee, and that doesn’t even touch upon how convenient it is. It’s an all-around winner in my book",5
4749,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/24/2021,"I have absolutely enjoyed Jot. To be honest, I was getting ready to quit coffee because other brands were too acidic, too bitter, too nutty, etc, but once I tried Jot, I doubt I’ll ever try anything else. 

It’s great how concentrated it is, 1 cup can be as strong or weak as I would like",5

I also added a bit of hazelnut syrup. I am so excited to have my next glass. I feel the options are endless with Jot!! I can’t wait to order more!",5
4753,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/23/2021,This coffee is so smooth and rich. Both my daughter and I love this just wish it wasn't so expensive.,5

4756,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/23/2021,So glad I gave Jot a try. My wife and I love it. I make a pitcher at a time and leave it in the fridge. Only downside to doing this is that if you make it too easy to drink it will disappear very quickly!,5
4757,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/23/2021,I don’t think I’ll go back to my usual ground coffee routine now that I am using Jot. Jot is definitely my fave.,5
4758,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/23/2021,"I love the taste of Jot coffee, but even better than that is the convenience and versatility it allows me. I'm always in a rush in the morning and I love that I can either make a hot or cold brew in a matter of seconds to take with me or down a couple of shots and be on my way. Highly recommended!",5

4761,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/22/2021,Jot is so amazing! It tastes great and it is sooooo convenient in the morning! Makes for a very quick (not to mention CHEAP compared to starbucks) to go iced coffee in the morning!,5
4762,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/22/2021,"I was averaging $150-$200 a month at Starbucks. It was actually quite sad and embarrassing. I decided to give Jot a try and am so glad I did. In fact, they put Starbucks’ coffee to shame. I’ve never had such an amazing cup of iced coffee. I mix mine with unsweetened vanilla almond milk and it’s AH-mazing! Highly recommend. I did not receive any free products for this review (although, I wish I did!).",5
4763,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/22/2021,"I usually drink at least one cup of coffee daily, especially during ice coffee season! I saw the ad, then realized how quickly I go through cold brew from the grocery store, and thought that this would certainly be a more sustainable option. not to MENTION THE COFFEE IS GREAT. super easy to make however you take your coffee, however I’ve only tried cold drinks so far, so I’m looking forward to trying Jot with my hot coffee as well.",5

I make it with three parts cold H20, one part flax milk with protein (any plant-based ""milk"" is scrumptious) and 1 spoon of JOT and life is beautiful once again. I love the chocolate-y notes that come out with this concoction. I must say that I cannot imbibe after 4 pm, otherwise a good night of sleep is more of a struggle. Love this addiction!",5
4766,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/22/2021,I use it while I’m at work and it does the trick. I had a co worker try it and she liked it. Smell and tastes like a just brew a cup. I like it,5
4767,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/22/2021,I had reservations about how this would taste. It’s very convenient and oftentimes you trade off taste in order to get convenience. That was not the case at all! I have been using it for iced coffees and it has a rich and fresh taste that I love. I subscribed and this will be part of my routine from now on. Very satisfied!,5
4768,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/22/2021,Love it Very easy Being a Charter boat Fishing Captian i run into lots of coffee drinkers so i bring hot water and serve them up send me some Decals and stickers for my boat https://gotchahookedfishtrip.com/,5

4775,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/21/2021,Jot makes delicious coffee. It’s hassle free with no cleanup other than a table spoon. Knowing that each time I drink a cup I’m not contributing to environmental waste with those one-use throw away plastic K Cups.,5

4778,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/21/2021,Instant coffee that will blow your freaking mind. Thanks for making an incredible product!,5
4779,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/20/2021,"I have to say that I'm not usually a big coffee person, at least when it's at-home coffee. Usually tastes pretty sour and makes me feel nauseous first thing in the morning. But honestly? Jot tastes great — rich, flavorful, not at all acidic — and it's been great to start the workday at home with an iced coffee in the summer.",5
4780,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/20/2021,"Wasn’t sure I would like this, but I LOVE IT! Smooth and delish. Easy to use and love the glass container",5

4782,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/20/2021,This coffee tastes so fresh and strong! It’s so easy to make and perfect for my busy mornings.,5
4783,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/20/2021,"I love drinking coffee and sometimes I really look forward to the ritual of grinding the beans and brewing up a whole french press of the good stuff for a lazy Sunday morning. Other times I'm barely dragging myself out of bed and need that caffeine hit to even begin to function like a normal human. But even on the days that I physically require this nectar of the gods to get my muddy sleep brain moving, I don't want to drink something that doesn't taste good. A lot of coffee concentrates or cold brews have this weird almost metallic aftertaste that really puts me off or they'll have these god awful sweeteners that mask that gross aftertaste but are still nasty. Jot fits what I need because I can pour a serving up with some water and oat milk and barely even need to be awake to make it work. It doesn't have that gross aftertaste and I get to choose whether I want to add any milk or sweeteners each day. On the weekends, I still get to do my coffee ritual, but on that M-F grind, I can whip up a cup as quickly as I can pour a bowl of cereal and still enjoy the thing I'm drinking in the end. I would recommend this to people that enjoy the flavor of coffee, but don't always enjoy the effort of brewing good coffee.",5
4784,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/20/2021,"As someone who’s baseline coffee order includes 4 shots of espresso, I was floored by this product. 1 teaspoon with hazelnut creamer does for me what 2 Starbucks grande’s do on a good day. 10/10 recommend Jot, especially for those individuals like me who are constantly on the move/living out of a suitcase and need a reliable source of easy, quick, and strong caffeine",5

4786,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/20/2021,"I bought this to make an imitation Starbucks drink that I enjoyed and it was the perfect addition. The ratio is no lie, one bottle makes many servings. Will definitely be a repeat customer.",5

4795,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/18/2021,"I bought Jot on a whim after a well placed Instagram ad caught my eye late one night.

4805,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/17/2021,"I am a coffee snob but couldn't be more pleased with Jot for allowing me to make the easiest and best tasting iced coffee. I like my coffee very strong and can't stand watered-down iced coffee that some coffee shops in town serve. With Jot it's not only extremely convenient to prepare it at home, but better than anything I can buy in person AND the cost per drink, so to say, is better too.

It’s going to be a great summer with Jot! ❤️",5
4831,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/15/2021,The coffee was great ! Something I’d buy over and over again.,5
4832,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/15/2021,"My husband and I decided to give this a try, having very little expectation about it, almost ready to be disappointed...because so many instagram ad items are disappointing. But this coffee is amazing! They shipped it to us very quickly, it's absolutely idiot proof to make it, and so so so convenient for making iced coffee at home!",5
4833,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/15/2021,The coffee really couldn’t be better. I despair at the idea of having all these nice bottles pile up in a landfill and wish that I could mail them back to be refilled.,5
4834,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/15/2021,I loved the bold flavor and that I’m not paying for all the water like I was with other cold brew I would buy.,5
4835,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/15/2021,This product is AMAZING! I am a avid coffee drinker and had my doubts. It is so smooth and doesn't give me the nasty taste that some coffees give. Great job !,5
4836,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/15/2021,Thought it would be dark strong coffee but turned out to be a bit light for my tastes. Also doesn’t save me much time since I can use my Jura espresso machine.,3

4839,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/15/2021,"After reading reviews saying this is a nice bold cup of coffee, I thought I’d give it a try. Excited, I ordered 3 of them and the spoon because of a special they had going. I really was hoping I would enjoy it as much as everyone else does. Unfortunately it isn’t as bold as I had wished, and it definitely has an instant coffee taste to it which I don’t enjoy. I love the idea behind the coffee, and also that it’s organic. I wish the company well and no harm in this review. Give it a try, you won’t know till you taste it for yourself if it’s the coffee for you.",3

4861,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/13/2021,"I’be never been a huge coffee drinker, but a few years ago I learned to tolerate cold brew because I really needed something to start my 12 hour shifts. I was hesitant to try Jot but was looking for something different and smaller in my fridge than my huge glass mason jar. After my first 2 cups I am officially a Jot follower and will never go back to the grounds. It’s everything I like about coffee with nothing that I don’t: it’s SO smooth, mixes great with water and milk (I love having this option now, you can’t just mix cold brew with a ton of milk for a latte), and is insanely easy to prepare. I’m so happy I gave Jot a chance! Did I mention how smooth it was? I’m trying to get all my friends to try Jot now, I had no idea what a world I was missing!",5

Jot’s Ultra Coffee stepped up my game. It has great flavor, and makes a good quick cup. I love mixing it with almond milk and a touch of maple syrup to cut the slight bitterness (not bad bitter, but it is a lingering flavor without a hint of something sweet). I’m happy with my purchase and intend to have it regularly on hand.",5
4866,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/13/2021,"It's remarkable how strong this stuff is. Just one Tablespoon is right. I prefer to drink in some oat milk, and it is so tasty. You simply can't beat how easy it is, and it will support you on those warming spring and summer days. Cheers!",5

FRIENDS, JUST ONE TABLESPOON. Don't get me wrong, I felt the rage of a thousand toddlers throwing tantrums and it got me super productive for the day but I was raging on well into 10p after my first cup at 6a. This product is dark, it is delicious. The flavor is amazing. You do not taste the bitterness you would taste in most espresso shots and it's so easy! Mix with water for a cup of coffee or add oatmilk to be a hipster. The opportunities are endless. I will absolutely be a repeat customer. Bravo, Jot Team!",5

I got a bottle of Jot to keep in my studio where I only have a hot water heater and no kitchen. This tastes like actual coffee, comparable to the coffee I drink at home. I was really surprised, and the texture of the concentrates mixes really well with hot water. This is the perfect solution for afternoon slumps in the studio when I don’t want to spend money or get a disposable cup of coffee. I will certainly be buying more in the future, thank you!",5

4941,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/07/2021,"Being able to just add the concentrate is so convenient for quick cups and it has a nice, almost sweet flavor, which I like because I don’t add sweetener. It’s a bold enough, but I also like that you can easily adjust the boldness just by adding more, whereas with regular coffee you can’t once brewed.",5

It would also be great if y’all offered a decaf version because I’m a coffee addict who is nursing a baby. Overall really liked it and already repurchased more bottles!,4
4947,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/06/2021,"This coffee is pretty good and the ease of making it is awesome.

I have only had this coffee iced, as an iced latte, but it was even better than I had hoped it would be. It had a great rich flavor, not acidic and super smooth. It wasn’t as strong as I typically drink, so I may make it with a tablespoon and a half..I have to sort that out a little bit. I will definitely buy it again.",5

I have bought a lot from the refrigerated section and also bottle coffees. The only ones I like have been heavily sweetened. I prefer iced lattes and typically brew espresso and take it with me to work to drink it over ice with oat milk. 

When I first mixed a tablespoon in 6 ounces of water and tried it I immediately though oh no this is too bitter. I then put a teaspoon of coffee syrup and a few ounces of frothed oat milk. It tasted amazing!! I take jot to work with me but I find it hard not to reach for it at home too. It is so convenient and I will be taking it with me for vacations/ day trips. I prefer to make my own coffee and sometimes it isn't the most convenient. I drink at least 3 coffees a day so drinking Jot all the time wouldn't be the most affordable for me but definitely going to be keeping it on hand!!",5

Jot is so smooth and almost tastes like chocolate, no bitterness at all. I also love that I can make a consistently good cup of coffee every morning. With a coffee maker it’s always hit or miss, even when I buy the good coffee. Even when you go to Starbucks, they sometimes burn the espresso shots and it ends up being gross. Highly recommend, just wish it were a little bit less expensive. While it’s FAR cheaper than Starbucks (or any coffee shop really), I don’t go to Starbucks everyday. It’s not quite as affordable as bagged coffee, BUT it tastes a lot better, so it may be worth it.

5049,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,04/29/2021,"Things fills a much needed gap in my life in more ways than one. Either replacing an afternoon pick me up that I would usually go out and spend money on or skipping brewing a whole pot that won't get drank on mornings when I am on my own, Jot takes care of all of that.",5

5052,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,04/29/2021,You always see reviews & wonder if they’re legit — or paid for by the company. I go to a particular coffee chain every morning. And every morning I pay about $6 for an iced mocha. Not only is that $42/wk — that’s a lot of fat/cal/sugar I’m putting into my body. I thought I would take a chance on JOT after seeing the ads on my socials … I’m so glad I did that! I was scared the coffee might have a harsh or bitter taste — it doesn’t! It’s super smooth! I’ve had an almond milk iced coffee every morning (& a couple afternoons) since I’ve gotten my delivery. So glad I decided to take a chance!,5

It’s perfect for moms who don’t have time to worry about making coffee (me), as well as people who live in apartments or just simply don’t want a big coffee machine in their kitchen (also me).

5072,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,04/27/2021,I’ve had a Starbucks habit for many many years. I’ve never found anything as good as their ice coffee with soy milk. I’ve lived in many locations and currently traveling and always stressed out about getting my Starbucks in the morning. I decided to try Jot to make my morning routine easier and not based on finding a Starbucks. The Jot coffee was very easy and worked out great. I then realized it was the soy milk that gave Starbucks the extra touch so I started buying an 8 oz cup of their soy milk to last me the week. I now use Jot in cold water with a few spoonfuls of Starbucks soy milk and its perfect. Saves money and hassle. I’m very happy I found Jot!,5

5159,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,04/22/2021,"About a week in I'm enjoy Jot. I had some other iced coffee concentrate left when I started, and on two coffee days I can honestly say that back to back, I prefer Jot over what I had bought before. At the cost, if I don't end up going through more than 2 bottles every 4 weeks, it's equal to what I spend on varying quality concentrates from in store. I'm planning on sticking to the auto-deliveries for a while.",5

I purchased 2 bottles just for fun to try it, and will probably have to get 2 more!",5
5169,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee (Trial),04/21/2021,"I was impressed with the taste and convenience, especially for making cold coffee beverages, but I am not sold yet. To me, the taste is still not quite on par with fresh brewed coffee, and I’m not sure that the price makes sense for me as a replacement for my everyday coffee habit (24oz - 32oz). It is a nice convenience, but I might reserve it for cold use or an easy, on the go option.",4
5170,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,04/21/2021,"Jot is wonderful. Makes the morning routine a breeze and delivers a smooth, delicious coffee. Jot has become my new go to morning Cold Brew, absolutely love it. Thanks Jot for the innovative thinking.

5178,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,04/21/2021,"One of the things I really don’t like about some places is the sour taste in their cold brew or nitro. I know this is a concentrate but it doesn’t have that taste. It’s a really bold flavor and just good with whatever dairy/nondairy creamy, or even water you put with it. Not to mention, loads of energy and I’m a nurse on the go all the time so it really works for me!

I used to buy Starbucks and Scooters to avoid the hassle of making it myself. Jot has made it so easy that I even play around with different recipes and I actually have fun doing it. It's so simple and yet it feels so fancy. Don't even get me started on the flavor! It's so smooth and rich. It's honestly the best coffee I've ever had, and I don't have to wait in line or pay $5 (or even more sometimes). If you like coffee that actually tastes like coffee and doesn't have that nasty sour twang that sometimes happens, then look no further.",5

5182,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,04/21/2021,Very easy to make my go to morning Iced Coffee. I like a heavier iced coffee and ad just a little extra Jot. This is also great for travel. Put the Jot bottle in my cooler and make a second cup. ,5

5184,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,04/20/2021,The first sip was soo smooth. I savored it for a brief second only because I couldn’t wait to have another. No bitter after taste. Totally addictive. I go to bed looking forward morning now. What a great way to start my day.,5
5185,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,04/20/2021,"My husband and I were very impressed with our first order. Not only does it taste great (hot or cold) but it creates such little waste, and takes up almost no room in the fridge. We will definitely be ordering more.",5

5187,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee (Trial),04/20/2021,"I ordered the test bottle and couldn't be happier. Very easy, convenient, clean and great tasting. Looking forward to my next bottle",5
5188,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,04/20/2021,I first want to try but with doubt! But it is amazing after I first try it! It goes well with adding ice or hot water! Drinking coffee has never been so easy! I am hooked!,5
5189,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,04/20/2021,"First impressions - the packaging and presentation feel premium. I was honestly expecting a plastic bottle but was pleasantly surprised to realize it's glass. I also like the narrow-opening top, which makes it easier to measure 1 Tbsp for each cup without spilling or over-pouring.

I prefer a bolder taste, so for me the measurement suggestion is off. To achieve that perfect cup, I'm guessing that 1 Tbsp for every 6 oz is closer to the mark. But for someone who drinks 2-3 cups per day on average, Jot would make for a very expensive cup of joe over time.

I do like the ""ready"" factor and have taken it both hot and cold, with milk and with water, and it does produce a consistent taste. I'll keep experimenting but am not sold on this replacing my everyday coffee routine.",4
5190,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,04/20/2021,I was a little skeptical at first. I always believed that coffee had to be freshly brewed and hot to be good. Jot changed that. I absolutely love the taste. And I also absolutely love the convenience of just adding Jot to some hot water to get my day going... Thank You Jot and Thank You Thomas Delauer for telling me about it.,5
5191,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,04/19/2021,Loved it! Can’t wait to have my next cup tomorrow! ,5

5194,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,04/19/2021,"Okay, never was a coffee drinker; it was just too bitter. Jot has changed that! Mix a bit of Jot in my preferred milk or oat milk, little flavoring, and I have one smooth, flavorful cold drink! Love everything but the price!",4
5195,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,04/19/2021,"This is the coffee I’ve been needing in my life! I had changed everything I consume over to organic...except my coffee. I don’t know how I missed that very important piece of the puzzle. Jot is the perfect solution - it’s organic and most importantly, it’s easy and so convenient- and tastes great too! So happy to have found it! ",5

5197,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee (Trial),04/19/2021,"I LOVE JOT! It’s better than ordering Starbucks or Dunkin Doughnuts on a daily basis. Less cost efficient, yet affordable and convenient with the touch of your hands. Totally worth the subscription. I can’t stress enough on how good this product is. It’s definitely life changing, one tablespoon of Jot can change your whole morning!!",5
5198,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee (Trial),04/19/2021,"Full disclosure, I used to only ever have one cup of coffee a day. Ever since trying Jot, though, I now look forward to an afternoon iced latte everyday. It’s insanely delicious and couldn’t be easier to make!!",5
5199,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,04/19/2021,"Jot coffee is the smoothest cup of coffee you’ll ever have. There is no bitter after taste. You don’t even need sweetener or milk but if you do use it, it will give your cup of coffee a dessert like quality. One bottle lasts for a good long time and I like that you can use water, milk, almond milk, etc to make the perfect cup. I would recommend this over the big coffee chains. Not only does Jot taste better it is also more economical. Highly recommend!",5
5200,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,04/19/2021,"Both Jot and Oneby coffee are quality concentrated coffees. That said, Jot wins out massively on bottle design functionality. The spot in Jot is a huge win. Unfortunately, I wouldn’t have known how much of a difference until I used Oneby Coffee. Their bottle design looks great but I’m losing drops of coffee after every tablespoon- that adds up! And although perhaps not as big of a margin of victory on the coffee itself, Jot was indeed a better taste and finish in my opinion. Great job Jot!!

5201,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,04/19/2021,Loving this new way to get my daily dose of caffeine. I’ve been pairing my Jot with oat milk and love it! Excited to explore other ways of using it!!,5

The simplicity and quickness of making a cup of coffee is just a bonus. I like to mix 1 tbsp with a protein drink and wow, it is truly better than any Starbucks drink I've had. Finally, I ACTUALLY FEEL ENERGIZED by this coffee - that's a huge accomplishment. I used to be a multi-shot espresso, Bang energy drink, preworkout taking fool and none of those things gave me any type of energetic boost. My first cup of this stuff I was like ""is this what it's supposed to feel like?!"" And now I'm hooked and will never go back. Thanks Jot for creating an awesome and easy way to enjoy coffee!",5

So tried different brands from powdered/instant to kcup coffees. I always need to add either flavored creamer or A LOT of sugar or substitute water for milk, just to get to how i would want my coffee to taste like. BUT not with Jot coffee. The taste is just indescribable. Its soo smooth and the taste is so rich. I dont even like drinking it with any type of milk. I love how it tastes with just water, a little sugar, a plain creamer and thats it. Its that good!

I received your coffee a few weeks ago in hopes to use it as a simple method to make a quick coffee in my piano bar.

Good luck to you and your business.

I’m the kind of person who orders a caffe latte breve, and then will still take the drink over to the condiment counter to add sweetener and half and half. And I’m not talking about that super strong stuff at Starbucks, either. I can’t drink that. I made an iced latte using Jot, ice, and half and half and that one tablespoon of Jot came in nice and strong. I was surprised how strong it tasted.

As coffee ""fanatics"", the instant pod machines, coffee makers and other modern conveniences don't cut it when it comes to our morning cup. Our go-to was a pour-over, a fairly involved and lengthy process, but resulting in a coffee that would satisfy our distinctive need for caffeine. We tried Jot out of curiosity and are now on our 4th bottle. We can make it cup by cup, so its always fresh. It feels like instant coffee, but tastes just like a pour over. I was also impressed with the packaging. Instead of foam to protect the glass bottles, stacked sheets of corrugated cardboard are used. It feels just as protective as a block of styrofoam but I can just toss it in the recycle bin! <3 Thank you for creating this product and being so thoughtful!",5

5478,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/28/2021,"Was very pleased with Jot. As a fan of stronger brew Jot was right in my wheelhouse. Very rich and intense flavor, highly recommend for any coffee connoisseur out there!",5
5479,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/28/2021,"I was at first skeptical about trying an ultra concentrated coffee. I must say after my first cup of Jot, I knew this was my new favorite coffee.

5480,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/28/2021,I was surprised how incredibly smooth the under notes of flavor were....no bitterness at all! Loved it!,5
5481,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/28/2021,Quick and taste better than the coffee I make at home. I make and drink my coffee in the morning at work during the week and on the weekend I don’t want to make a whole pot for just me. This has been a great solution and the taste is Amazing!,5
5482,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/28/2021,"I really love Jot it is so smooth and perfect to drink black either hot or cold. I love not needing any appliances to make such a great cup of coffee.

5483,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee (Trial),03/28/2021,Jot is my new morning and afternoon pick me up! I pour a tablespoon over my iced oat milk and it is incredible! And saves me tons of money at coffee shops! Love it!,5
5484,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/28/2021,"I'm a bit snobbish when it comes to coffee concentrate and this does indeed check all the boxes for me. It's on the darker side, which will put off a select few, but it's not burnt or ""instant"" tasting. I think I need to experiment more with the ratios and temperatures, but I've been having it over ice with the 1TBSP/8oz ratio. Probably going to order some more.

One actionable piece of feedback: while volumetric measurements are fine when it comes to fluids, most anyone with a kitchen scale would probably appreciate the instructions as a ratio of masses.",4
5485,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/28/2021,"I’ve been tinkering with different coffee blends and methods for months. I’ve been cutting back on the bucks and trying to save money while also enjoying my one cup of coffee a day. Since my first order with Jot, I’ve completely stopped buying coffee out. I’ve also saved a butt load of time by simply making my coffe with the concentrate vs. the press method. I make my own brown sugar syrup, mix that with oat milk some purified water and ice cubes and I kid you now... there is really nothing better. I order two bottles every two weeks and honestly have considered upping it to 3. 10/10 5 stars I will never make coffee any other way.",5
5486,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/27/2021,We love Jot..... will never go back to “regular” store bought coffee or chain stores again!,5
5487,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/27/2021,"I loved my very first cup and it was actually love at first taste when a friend shared a dot of Jot with me!
I was sold then and now I enjoy it (at my convenience and pleasure) when ever I crave a cup...which is often (who needs sleep, right??) I’ve learned to pace myself, lol ",5
5488,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/27/2021,"Loved the convenience and that it didnt taste like instant coffee!! I wish bottle was a little bigger. It will in know way last me a month!

5490,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/27/2021,"Very good and always the same flavor NO bitterness. I am still figuring out what strength I can do first time I didn’t eat and my stomach did not like it! I shared with co workers who drink alot more coffee and they liked it.
",5
5491,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/27/2021,"Jot is the perfect at-home coffee solution. I’m such a snob for lattes that I won’t even enjoy regular coffee, let alone consider making it at home. I’d rather walk 20 mins each morning to buy a latte. But, with Jot, I can pour a delicious iced “latte” at home in seconds while saving so much money!",5
5492,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/27/2021,"It really was so smooth. I love it. I still like to make my coffee though. You guys should offer beans in a bag as well. GREAT COFFEE. I don’t feel all jittery either. I will buy again. I also think it’s a great concept for people that just wanna have one coffee and get away from drinking way too much. It actually I feel makes you drink less one cup a day maybe two.
",5
5493,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/27/2021,Really liked it,5
5494,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/26/2021,This coffee surely puts a pep in your step. The flavor is quite nice without cream but I definitely added cream to mine. I’ve almost finished the first bottled coffee  (drinking about 32oz of coffee (4 tbsp of Jot) per day for three days now. I’m glad I purchased the two bottle subscription.,5
5495,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/26/2021,"I was skeptical at first because it was a product that kept getting advertised on my social media. I kept reading the comments and the awesome reviews, so I decided to go ahead and give it a try. Needless to say, I’m hooked! So smooth, so good, and gives me that extra kick I need in the mornings. It’s only been a week and I’m ready to order my next two bottles!!",5
5496,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/26/2021,I love it. Easy to make. Great taste. Only thing I'd change is to buy a bigger bottle.,5
5497,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/26/2021,"Makes a great quick iced milk coffee. Doesn't go quite as well with steamed milk, but that's OK, because it's so d*nged good with cold milk or Oatley.",5
5498,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/26/2021,My first cup was such a surprise it was probably the best coffee I ever had! I am a tea drinker but this coffee will be my weekend indulgence!,5

5500,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/26/2021,so easy and delicious! I can quickly make a cup of latte/cold blew with Jot. Must have for WFH life!,5
5501,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/26/2021,"It’s aggressively cut down on my prep time of either making coffee at home, or waiting in line to buy a coffee. The convenience almost outweighs the flavor, but the flavor is a huge contender! Not bitter which was my main concern with it being a concentrate. Highly recommended!",5
5502,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/26/2021,"I'm trying to learn to drink coffee black and I thought this may be the answer! Well, I'm still working on that however, Jot is delicious and convenient and I think it will make it easier to transition to black coffee. Eventually. It's smooth and flavorful. I use it as my 2nd cup at work or my first cup when I wake up after a long night at work.",5
5503,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/24/2021,"Great coffee taste when I started the bottle. It’s been approx 1.5 week since opening and some flavor loss. 
Not sure I want to buy again.",3
5504,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/24/2021,"I never knew coffee could be so easily made! Great flavor and rich tasting! You will not be disappointed!
",5
5505,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/24/2021,This stuff is a such a good concept. They nailed the flavor and forgot the bitterness. Wouldn't make it my daily driver but an afternoon treat or after dinner indulgence is great.,4
5506,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/24/2021,"I have enjoyed Jot every single morning! This is what I just needed thank you so much. Mom fuel for sure!
",5
5507,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/24/2021,"I thought the coffee had great presentation and the small bottle was pretty cute. I will probably reuse the bottle! I appreciate the limited use of plastics in the shipping and for the actual product.

The coffee was a bit too strong for my taste using the recommended serving. It had a very intense sour front end which I didn't find very pleasing, but the sourness did turn into more mellow, complex and fun notes which I appreciated. It also is very high in caffeine which wasn't my cup of tea. So I ended up halving the recommended serving per 8 ounces, and added some milk to help the sour front end. That created a much more tasty and less jittery cup, though of course, the coffee then ended up being a bit weak.

If we could decrease the sour front end and bring the caffeine down, I could probably be a repeat buyer for special occasions. I don't know if the price is worth it for me, but caffeine junkies will probably appreciate it more.",4
5508,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/23/2021,I'm a bit of a coffee snob but was curious to give Jot a try. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. I don't have the opportunity to grind and brew fresh coffee everyday so this was the perfect solution to get a great tasting cup quickly. Will purchase again!,5
5509,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/23/2021,"I was a little nervous after buying Jot seeing it on an instagram ad, but I was so impressed. I have been making iced oat milk lattes everyday and LOVING them.",5

5511,jot.co,Jot,Wavelength Ultra Coffee (Limited Edition),03/23/2021,"I must say, JOT is the real deal... My usual go to coffee used to be Starbucks; however, after trying and failing in love with JOT, I’m giving Starbucks the boot. The taste of JOT is smooth and subtle just the way I like it. I only drink coffee on the weekends and love the convenience of the bottled version of coffee. I also love the cost savings of not spending time and gas driving to my local Starbucks on the weekends.
This purchase was my first bottle and will say will not be my last!!",5
5512,jot.co,Jot,Wavelength Ultra Coffee (Limited Edition),03/23/2021,I have not gone back to my brewed coffee since I tried Jot a week ago. Love it in my oat milk lattes!!,5

5519,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/22/2021,This is freaking incredible! I wasn’t sure what to think of a concentrate coffee. But it completely blew my mind with the flavor without being over powering and bitter. Mixes so well in a protein shake for a protein and caffein breakfast! So happy i clicked a subscription so I never have to be without this. ,5
5520,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/22/2021,"I was skeptical to try, but very glad it did. It makes a great cup of coffee. I've tired it hot and iced, with milk and without. It is very consistent. 4 stars, because I don't love the flavor. While very good, it has an underlying sourness to it that is not my favorite flavor profile for coffee. It is mild enough, that I will likely order again.",4
5521,jot.co,Jot,Wavelength Ultra Coffee (Limited Edition),03/22/2021,"I am a sucker for advertising, so I tried this on a whim. I was surprised how easy and delicious Jot is. An added bonus for me, is the small footprint in my refrigerator. I'm a convert.",5

5528,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/22/2021,Being busy and on the go this Ultra coffee is so convenient and delicious. I live in a van and it’s nice to just pour 1tbsp in a cup and add hot water and/or a milk of choice and hit the road. It truly tastes like you brewed a fresh cup! I give it a thumbs up!,5
5529,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/22/2021,"I love this product so much! I’m a total coffee snob and even Starbucks is just “ok” in my opinion but it’s convenient so I always drank it. Not anymore! Jot is so easy to make and goes with literally anything you have in your house! I love adding it to protein drinks and using MCT oil or butter to it for a keto drink.

5549,jot.co,Jot,Wavelength Ultra Coffee (Limited Edition),03/20/2021,"I bought this because I was looking for an easy way to make cold brew, but I liked it so much that I started making lattes with it too. It’s delicious and I enjoy the ease of not having to brew fresh every time. I didn’t realize the serving size was so small though, each tablespoon makes an 8 oz coffee. Who drinks just one 8 oz coffee? I also don’t want to entirely give up the ritual of brewing, so I’ll probably buy it occasionally but not going to subscribe.",5

The frother - not so much. Worked one time, then totally quit. So sad. a spoon just does not mix it up enough into our coffee and it lays gunky at bottom of mug. It says its a great frother, but come on guys. If that's half your package, make sure they work. Unless I am sent a replacement frother that works, I would have given a 5 star, had it come without the frother being advertised as such a great addition.",4

Before Jot my mornings were either Starbucks runs or taking the time to make an iced latte with the espresso machine which is a pain (but worth it when I have the time). What an amazing addition to my rotation - much faster and equally as delicious. I pour it directly into oat milk over ice, and occasionally add some coconut creamer and it truly slaps.

I tried Jot with just water — to develop an honest opinion of the brew — and I was pleasantly surprised with the taste. This was my first experience with a coffee that I did not feel the need to cover up the bitterness with a sweetener or an additional flavor such as vanilla or hazlenut. 

I now enjoy Jot with either 6 oz of water and a splash of milk, or an all-milk cafe latte.

My expensive Starbucks habit has been eradicated!",5

Rest assured this is absolutely the best thing I ever did to change my routine! This coffee concept is unbelievable! I have not been so excited about a product and change in my routine in a long time.

",5
5645,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/14/2021,"But will give 4 stars because it’s not bad at all.

First I will say, I’m not a huge coffee drinker (as I don’t have one every day but can do a few times a week then none for a week, etc.)

Taste: 3 stars it’s has a strong bitter flavor (especially if you taste test the concentrate - don’t do that lol) however, if you pour the exact amount per recommended water/milk it has the bitter coffee flavor but at the same time not strong enough. If you put a little more you will increase the flavor, yes, but also give yourself a bitter after taste. So you will have to play around with the ratio to your choosing for a bit.

Ease: 4.5 stars with the exception of the above, it’s fairly easy to make and super quick. I drink iced coffee so this beats having to make hot coffee and waiting for ice to cool it down. I’d skip this if you’re a hot coffee drinker: if you still have to heat up water, just use a Keurig and some pods.

Price: 3 stars it’s pretty expensive for a non-coffee drinker but relatively cheaper than getting a cup at your local coffee shop. However, I’m not sure it’s as strong as theirs. I don’t feel like I get a caffeine fix when I drink this. I would consider having this regularly as a subscription at the price point of the introductory offer. Not sure if I would continue otherwise, but I haven’t finished my first bottle yet so let’s see if I get hooked enough to warrant the expense.

Pros: tastes pretty good, quick and easy, great for iced coffee, seems to last for a while

Cons: getting your preferred taste takes some adjustments, not recommended for hot coffee, may not provide the caffeine jolt needed to sustain your day, a bit pricey outside of introductory offer 

Tip: use this to make your coffee liqueur cocktails! You’re welcome :)",4
5646,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/14/2021,I was skeptical that this would be good but after having my second French press break I needed something convenient. This hit the the spot and knocked it our of the park! I’ve recommended this to all my WFH friends!,5
5647,jot.co,Jot,Wavelength Ultra Coffee (Limited Edition),03/14/2021,"I normally make gourmet, cafe-style coffee that has cost me $1500+ in equipment. On a scale of Folgers to my coffee, the taste of Jot is about a 6-7, which is fantastic since concentrates are really hard to make.

There are days when I wake up fifteen minutes before work and I don't have time to brew a gourmet cup. Sometimes, I have a quick break between meetings but need to perk up. This stuff functions amazingly well for that, while being cheaper than energy drinks. Therefore, I'll probably make it a permanent part of my lifestyle, even if it's not my only caffeine source.",5

5677,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/12/2021,One of my best experiences with a cup of coffee. I couldn't wait to share my new found pleasure with my coffee gurus and friends!,5
5678,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/12/2021,I like to try all the new versions of instant coffee out in the market and this one came to my attention. Although initially shocked by the price it actually is a decent price for how many cups you can get out of one little bottle. I bought the classic and the wavelength flavors. Overall the convenience is there but the flavor leaves something to be desired. There is a residual bitterness that most instant coffees have and the flavor of the wavelength wasn’t as nuanced or complex as I hoped it would be. It’s still better than most instant coffees but I’d rather stick to Swift or Viola.,3
5679,jot.co,Jot,Wavelength Limited Edition (Sample),03/12/2021,Wonderful brew. Super easy and delicious! ,5

5699,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/10/2021,"I recently try this coffee, and fall in love with it. The first thing is the convenience of having decent tasting coffee anytime at decent price without have to run to the store. You can enjoy it hot or cold. And it doesn’t water down your latte! I’ve been obsessed with oat milk latte and the plus thing is it doesn’t give me heartburn! Woo hoo! I also really like the taste of Wavelength and hope I can get discount price on that!",5

5702,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/10/2021,"Not gonna lie, coffee concentrate is a genius idea. Points for that. But the taste is just average. A little bland, almost too smooth, with no kick. Good to have on hand for cold coffee, but if you want a cup that wakes you up even before you taste it, this is not it. ",3

5709,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/10/2021,"When I got my first bottle it seemed there was some coffee residue on the bottle or some kind of sticky substance anyway. I wish the coffee was a little stronger but I adjust accordingly. Overall, I love the idea of supporting a company like this compared to buying keurig cups over and over again. This makes things a lot easier to prepare if I want an americano or latte or simple delicious cup of cofefe.

5716,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/09/2021,"Hello,

Great personal experience. I wish my wife would have liked it as much as I did. She didn't know what to do with the coffee so she tried her own way, but unfortunately didn't like it - I think it had something to do with her choice of milk, and she stated that it's too bitter for her. It's a different product that requires different preparation than we've been conditioned for.

-Harry",3
5717,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/09/2021,My initial thought was great taste but not very strong. I have to mix 4-5 teaspoons for a good strong tasting cup of coffee. I didn’t expect that.,4

5727,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/08/2021,"When I first got Jot, I thought it would be a fun thing to try out once or twice. After using it a few times, I knew I could never go back to the instant coffee I had grown so accustomed to. Becoming an Ultra Coffee regular meant my standards for taste, quality, and - let's be honest - branding were forever heightened. In other words, order Jot at the risk of never accepting anything less amazing.",5
5728,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/08/2021,"At first I was skeptical - how much could one tbsp of coffee do? But it really packs a punch. The thick and syrupy coffee concentrate mixes so well with water and soy milk (and I'm sure much more!) and makes my afternoon cup super easy. When my time is limited (even in WFH!) I need a quick pick me up, and this is just the ticket.",5
5729,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/08/2021,Legit LOVE this coffee. The taste is strong (if too strong you can always add more water but I like it that way). I personally love to keep it at work for a mid day pick me up without having to run out and buy coffee (the coffee at my job is awful). I also loved to add just a very tiny bit to my normal coffee for a little kick! This stuff is amazing ! Gave me great energy without the jitters too!,5
5730,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/08/2021,"My go-to coffee is a French Press but then there are times when I don't want to deal with the cleaning and brew time.

5731,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/08/2021,I was surprised at how rich and intense my first cup of Jot was. The big aroma and buzz was much more like a fine Cafe cup of rich coffee flavor with lots of caffeine energy!,5
5732,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/08/2021,"Love it. Smooth, clean flavor and oh so quick! Pretty proud of y'all for creating such a great product. One of the things I like best is it takes up no room in the fridge! And I can hide the bottle so I can save it just for me - I am so naughty - but I did! Oh and the packaging is fab!

So far I’ve added a spoon to about 3 or 4 spoons of extra creamy oat milk , microwaved a minute or so , and it came out somewhere between a delicious latte or macchiato, just a lot quicker to make. 
Also did a similar mix over ice and that was like a Vietnamese coffee without all the extra sweetness, really good. 
And it’s as potent as promised . So far I like Jot a lot, and will definitely be ordering more!",5
5749,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/08/2021,"I hate the Keurig: even the eco reusable things spurt coffee grounds out at me at all hours of my shift. Also, I am not a huge fan of the commercially made coffees that the hospital I work at gives us.Too acidic. Enter: Jot. Stays in my locker when I am not at there and is super easy to make with hot or cold water.... Which means I don’t have to wait forever for a brew. Jot tastes amazing, just however you want it. Light, heavy, whole bottle in one go.... yum. I love night shift, and I Love Jot!
",5
5750,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/08/2021,"I am a picky coffee-drinker. Whenever I visit a new place, I stop by local coffee shops to taste new coffee beans. I have a Breville espresso machine for dark/medium roast and Chemex for light roast beans at home. Due to my curiosity and desire to taste a great coffee, I tried Jot coffee. 

Tastewise, Jot coffee has a well-balanced, silky smooth, and strong chocolate taste. But not much like delicate (fruity) notes that you can feel in the light roast bean. However, it is much more convenient if you are very busy than the Breville Espresso machine (Semi-Auto) or Chemex (Pour over). Less time is spent. 
I hope that they release a new taste of coffee with more delicate notes that make you more enjoyable esp. in iced coffee. 

An interesting experience for me!",4

5785,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/06/2021,"I used to be a coffee snob. I have had a cup of coffee prepared and brewed in most every way possible. I have yet to find a coffee I did not like for one reason or another (turkish is my least favorite though I am not sure it was made properly either time). My wife does not drink coffee so unfortunately I typically am using K-cups for my daily dose and a small french press if I have good beans for my burr grinder and time (I even have a travel french press mug LOL). I found this concentrate to be bitter, not smooth. After a few different attempts at hot coffee I gave up. I usually drink it black but switch it up with cream or vanilla cream. That did not help either.",3

5815,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,03/04/2021,"JOT has got a lot! I am enjoying this system that allows you to make a great cup of coffee quickly. For us coffee drinkers the taste is what it is all about. The system is easy and the best part is the pour spout of the bottle holding the strong coffee...never a drop spilled or dripping down the side of the bottle. The thermos cup is good; at first having to unscrew the lid each time seemed a bit arduous but now I am used to it. It actually adds an “intention” to that sip of coffee. 
I usually take 20-30 minutes to make my morning Illy cup of coffee; heating the cup, heating the filter holder, grinding the coffee, heating the water to 205°, pour over slowly, frothing the 1/2 & 1/2...a lot of steps for one cup coffee. But now there is JOT that does not disappoint in flavor...and the convenience is always a surprise. I usually walk out the door with a JOT in hand for later in the day. Always a welcome sip when I want some coffee. 
Any drawbacks...for now none. I am getting used to not needing a long intensive coffee system to make a great cup of coffee...JOT HAS GOT",5

I thought I got a beverage from a coffee house. I’m even considering putting my keurig duo plus away and sticking with this.

The cost of this quickly added up and I often felt myself feeling guilty for buying such expensive coffee on a regular basis. With Jot, I’ve been able to have iced coffee each morning without the guilt of the cost. Not only that, it tastes amazing. I like adding a little vanilla syrup at times but have found the taste of the coffee is so smooth I don’t really need the syrup which also makes me feel good that I’m not adding a bunch of sugar to my morning routine. I’ve tried to make my own iced coffee on my own but just never found a quick and easy way that tasted that great...until Jot!

I’m used to making coffee in the morning in my Chemex, and I assumed I would continue. Wrong. The Chemex is gathering dust. I love Jot, the flavor is amazing. It’s smooth coffee, you can have it hot or cold, and it’s just too easy. ",5

I used to get a coffee drink all the time and they stopped making it. This tastes exactly like it so needless to say I am ecstatic LoL! It doesn’t taste syrupy as you would think. It’s smooth, not bitter at all. I haven’t tried hot yet because I live down south and it’s hot every day. But, as far as the ice drinks go it’s been great. I was making espresso and ice lattes. This substitutes perfectly for my espresso. I posted up on my Instagram on hanabananapants about it and I’ll probably post more bc I’ve been drinking it everyday 😂",5

Sometimes just love a mild Dunkin coffee, sometimes want our strong Nespresso, and sometimes in the mood for a perfect cold brew. Buying cold brew has been so hit and miss in the grocery store that I wasn't sure how we'd like Jot, but it's PERFECT. Strong, classy coffee for a workday morning, or the base for a milky, chill coffee later in the day. We love it.",5

5988,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,02/18/2021,Works so smoothly in my work office. Great for an afternoon almond milk latte! So easy to make and tastes strong enough for my picky coffee assessment. Only negative is that I didn’t realize it has to be refrigerated after opening? It’s in very fine print on bottle. A luxury to have at my office for sure. Would love to have in decaf too!,5

When it came in, the packaging alone was something special. I love the all black box and the beautiful spoon in the middle (yes, I am excited over a spoon....). 

I boiled about a cup of water and then added my husbands favorite coffee creamer with a splash of half and half and he was said “WOW, this stuff is delicious”.

I shared once but after my first cup i hid the bottle cause i love it so much!! My hubby is coming home from a trip tonight and i'm going to surprise him with a cup in the morning!!! I think he is really going to love it... My daughter wants to know if you make a decalf bottle!! This coffee is very smooth and not bitter. You dont have to worry about coffee grounds in your cup and the coffee is perfect every time! I read you are supposed to put One Tablespoon for 8 oz but i like a 12 oz cup so i used a tablespoon and a half and it was awesome!! The great thing is you can adjust the strength to make it just as weak or as strong as you like it for each cup!! You cant do that with a machine!!! This coffee is my new favorite! Makes me wish the bottles were bigger!! Oh and when it comes in the mail it is beautifully packaged so you think youre getting a gift. Very classy.... thanks,5

6203,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee (Trial),02/04/2021,"I love Jot! I’m over the moon for Jot lattes. I can make my coffee drinks at home, and they taste as good as or better than what I used to order in pricey coffee bars—and at a third to half the cost. As a diabetic, I can enjoy a completely satisfying latte using fat-free milk, unsweetened vanilla almond milk or unsweetened oat milk while not messing with my blood sugar levels or my successful weight loss efforts. I whole-heartedly recommend Jot for any coffee lover!",5

I can throw this is a cup with ice and almond milk and run!! It tastes sooooo good, mixes up perfectly with any type of milk! Also makes your protein shake taste bomb. It is the seriously perfect scoop of dark liquid gold any time of day. Highly recommend for anyone but even more for those in the go!",5
6205,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,02/04/2021,I had been holding off writing a review until I had the opportunity to really try this coffee. I have to say - I am impressed. I LOVE that it’s a local Colorado company and that the logo has a bunny! The taste is smooth. I have done both water and dairy free milk and like both options equally. I am so glad I took the chance in trying Jot!,5
6206,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,02/04/2021,"I received a bottle as a gift and was immediately hooked. Before trying it out, I had reservations about both the caffeine amount and the taste. However, I was pleasantly surprised by my first cup of latte made from Ultra Coffee and found it comparable to what I’d get in a coffee shop. After some experimentation, I found the ratio of Ultra Coffee to milk that doesn’t make me too jittery but still tastes strong. The best part is, it’s so easy to make - a huge step up from aeropress. I’ve signed up for a subscription recently and was yet again pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to manage a subscription.

I went through so many trials of making it myself (gross to clean and way too bitter) to the canned stuff (you can almost taste the aluminum). But This is NEXT LEVEL.Ultra is an understatement. It so easy to just scoop in your concentrated coffee. I wasn’t expecting a cute little silver spoon but it was an amazing surprise! The taste is way better than anything I’ve had - honestly probably won’t go back to buying it anymore. I make it with 8oz of water , One ultra spoonful, and a dash of almond milk.",5

This is NOT like instant coffee. Yes, it's fast, but it's so so delicious. Has notes of cinnamon and vanilla and it's not too bitter either. I am not a bitter coffee person.

6320,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee (Trial),01/30/2021,"The presentation was great. Sturdy black box promising rich, dark, heady coffee. Sadly, in my opinion, one tablespoon (enclosed) did not provide that depth of flavor I was looking for; neither did 2 tablespoons. However, my husband does which proves it's not everyone's ""cup of coffee"" ( see what I did there?)
Good luck with your product.",5
6321,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,01/30/2021,I am a coffee fanatic and I have never had coffee so rich and smooth! This coffee beats out my 400$ nespresso by a long shot! I’m so glad I took the chance on this!,5

The pour spout on the bottle makes it easy to measure out without spilling everywhere. The bottles are small and easy to stash in the fridge. The best part is it’s easy to make either hot or cold, to whatever kind of liquid you want, whether it’s just water or oat milk or ice cream...",5

6328,jot.co,Jot,Wonderland Ultra Coffee (Limited Edition),01/30/2021,"I love this coffee. It has a rich, deep flavor with no bitter aftertaste. It reminds me of the super-expensive, hand-poured coffee I used to get myself as a treat at the end of a long week back when office life was still a thing. This is much more convenient and affordable. So glad I discovered Jot!",5
6329,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,01/30/2021,"Literally makes my morning so much easier and so much fun! I pick my choice of milk, added syrup or not, pour in a tablespoon and add ice. I am my own barista and customize it to whatever I feel like for the day. And I can still fall asleep at night! So friggen AWESOME!!!!",5
6330,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,01/30/2021,"I’m admittedly a bit of a coffee snob so when I was influenced to try Jot I was a bit skeptical. I’ve tried cold brew “concentrates” before and always found that I had to use much more than the recommended amount for it to be to my liking, otherwise it just tasted watered down. Jot is not that!!! A tablespoon really goes along way, and as an iced coffee lover, it’s so easy to make iced coffees or lattes to go to work in the morning. I love it so much that I’ve also used it for weekend espresso-tinis!! Highly recommend and probably the first subscription service I’ve done that I don’t plan on canceling after the first month.

6331,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,01/30/2021,"I am a particular kind of coffee drinker. I don’t like it strong but don’t Ike it watery either. I have tried every kind of singe cup pod type of coffees I can find and have not been happy with it. 

I’ll have to say I tried Jot at full throttle the first time and for me it was ok but way to strong. The next time I fixed it it was 3/4 spoonful. IT WAS PERFECT!!!! I am loving the stuff. Have only tried it hot so far but plan on trying it cold soon. Thank you. This is great stuff!",5

6334,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee (Trial),01/30/2021,"Great bold but smooth coffee flavor. I add this to my chocolate protein shakes and have added it to brownies too. 

I was skeptical of a coffee concentrate because others I’ve tried in the past tend to separate quickly after mixing and sink to the bottom of the milk or water I used to mix. Other kinds also taste very watery/weak tasting unless I use more than the serving suggested - which defeats the purpose of paying for a concentrate.",5

6341,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,01/30/2021,We have enjoyed using Jot coffee. The flavor is rich and creamy. There is a difference if you are expecting hot brewed flavor. But great for travel I’m a little cooler for camping for great cup anywhere with no hassle.,5
6342,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee (Trial),01/29/2021,"I was skeptical but it tastes really good. I used it in some homemade coffee ice cream so good! Also just added to hot water and easy great tasting cup of coffee.
The only thing is the cost is kind of steep for just 14 cups of coffee.",5
6343,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,01/29/2021,I used to brew my coffee the night before and keep it in the refrigerator over night.

As someone who typically doesn’t enjoy drinking coffee black, I was surprised to find that I love the taste of this coffee and never feel the need to add any type of creamer. I’ve also enjoyed how easy it is to make this coffee and with an eight month old, easy and quick is a must!

6352,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,01/29/2021,"Never thought a prep process this easy would create a cup of coffee this good. It rivals my every day cup in flavor and convenience but, sadly, not in price. The cost is my only issue with this product. I have no doubt that the price is justified, I just can't fit it into my budget right now. I will order again and try to always have an unopened bottle on hand for entertaining, when I start entertaining again. It will make it so much easier for everyone to have their perfect individual cup of coffee. Good job.",4

Thank you for listening to feedback.
Organic coffee is very important to me. As a woman organic coffee plays a key role to keeping a healthy reproductive system. Therefore, I look for organic coffee only. 
Secondly, I love that this is so quick to make BUT doesn’t compromise flavor!

I really love this coffee and have even recommended it to friends!

Thank you,
Heidi

I would recommend mixing with 8oz of water/milk for your first cup and then you can adjust from there if needed but I think that ratio is perfect. My favorite is mixing it with milk for a nice weekend treat. The second reason I love it is the convenience factor, all you need is 1 tablespoon (very nice one provided). The bottle opening insert was designed for precise pouring and there’s virtually no mess from coffee remnants running down the side like a traditional bottle would. I think this is an excellent product and they’ve thought of everything, I highly recommend it to anyone who drinks coffee, even if not regularly.",5

I’m an avid coffee drinker and I like my coffee both hot and cold, latte, cappuccino, espresso - depending on my mood. I saw an Ad for Jot and thought I’d give it a try.

I was skeptical at first mostly because how could you “premake” so much flavor. But I would say it’s much better than most of the commercial coffee shop coffees and more akin to a cup from your favorite little shop. I actually prefer it black than with milk. (I usually use milk..... sorry guys lol) so that’s saying a lot for me.

I actually doubted it would be as good as the advertisement claimed but I thought, you don’t know till you try. So I bought a single bottle. Truly amazing.

Amazing job!",5

I'm so glad I did! I love a good fresh cuppa, but a combination of factors means I don't usually have time in the morning before work to make a coffee before hitting the road. Grind the beans, wait for the kettle to come up to temperature, brew, clean up... that's about 15 minutes of time I don't have and I usually end up hitting up the Local Coffee Chain to get my fix -- it's fast, but it doesn't taste great, it's bad for me, it's not easy on the wallet. 
BUT NOW: It takes me about two minutes to put some ice and oat milk in my favourite tumbler and measure out two scoops of Jot and I'm on my way! It's super tasty, and even with doubling up (two scoops of Jot per drink) it's still way cheaper than getting a large coffee at any coffee chain. Very happy I took the plunge :)",5

I can’t say I had high hopes for a coffee concentrate, but am easily influenced (aka marketing sucker) to try new things, so I figured, why not. I’ve tried everything from home coffee brews, french press, and single serve espresso, in combination with every syrup, sauce, and cream on the market- you name it. But, I have always been unable to replicate that high end coffee shop flavor. Holy **** though, I am blown away by this stuff. Even with all of my syrups and creams, the flavor and body of this coffee comes through and is amazing. I definitely recommend this to anyone, whether you be a coffee purest or a sweet-tooth Sally, such as myself.

I think it still has strong flavor which I enjoy because I can add the right amount of oat milk and flavoring I want without feeling like I'm just drinking sugar water.

It’s better than any coffee shops I’ve been to. It’s so easy to pour 1 tbs in a cup for a hot latte or cold iced coffee.

6931,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,12/23/2020,"The coffee is good, but has a very strong flavor to it. I prefer a fresh made cup of pour over personally. However, the coffee is great when I'm in a hurry and dont have time to brew. It does the job.",3
6932,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,12/23/2020,"I really have been enjoying the Ultra Coffee. It's incredibly easy. All I have to do is add a Tbs to my milk and sugar and I'm good to go. I do prefer about 12 oz. of milk instead of 8, but the taste is still fantastic and lasts a little longer! I would also love to see some flavored coffee.",5
6933,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,12/23/2020,The minute I opened the bottle I knew I would love this product. It made me feel like I had an espresso machine without the machine and time it takes to make one. This is the only coffee I've tried that doesn't make my at home coffee taste watered down. Give it a try you won't be disappointed ,5
6934,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee (Trial),12/23/2020,"I enjoyed my first and second cup of JOT. It put a smile on my face. Very smooth, flavorful with no acidic after taste.",5
6935,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee (Trial),12/23/2020,This coffee has great flavor and is very convenient to use. I will be ordering more,5
6936,jot.co,Jot,Wonderland Ultra Coffee (Limited Edition),12/22/2020,"I really liked the taste of Wonderland, but it didn't taste strong enough. I had to use 2-3 tbsp, instead of 1. Sometimes, I mixed that with tbsp of the Ultra Coffee, to get my fix of caffeine! The taste reminded me of the Illy espresso I drink everyday. 
The Ultra Coffee was smooth and tasty, however, I had to use 2 tbsp of Jot in each cup, and that reduced the amount of cups in each bottle. I ran out of coffee sooner than I should have. I'm willing to try Jot again, because I loved how quickly I was able to have my cup of Joe ready with no fuss. I don't want a subscription right now because I still have to play around with the right amount of tbsp.",4
6937,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee (Trial),12/22/2020,"Ok this is great. I was skeptical at first but this is way better than k cups, a coffee pot, etc. Its a very good cup of coffee. I’m subscribing!",5
6938,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee (Trial),12/22/2020,"I ordered this to give as a gift and after I received it in the mail yesterday, I was SO tempted to keep it for myself. SO, I have a small problem...do I wait to find out what my friend thinks of it, or do I not tell my friend I kept their gift, and try it for myself? LOL. Whatever I decide to do, I will definitely let you know what I think. Thanks...and Merry Christmas!",4
6939,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee (Trial),12/22/2020,"I took a chance and I am glad I did! Smooth, no after taste, and very mild but a true coffee flavor! Ordered some for a gift to my sister. This was wonderful!",5

6942,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,12/22/2020,"Let me start by saying I don’t like coffee. I hate st*rbucks, there are two local coffee shops I have tried out of 100 that I think are actually good. Coffee never tastes good to me. I prefer my coffee to be the least abundant ingredient in my drink, I’d rather there be plenty of cream and milk and powdered flavor added to hide the nasty coffee taste... but this is pretty good. For it being so easy to make, and help cut down on waste, I’m here for it.",5
6943,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee (Trial),12/22/2020,"I have to be honest, I was really skeptical but ALL those 5-star reviews convinced me to give Jot a try. I am so glad I did. I’ve enjoyed my first cups: oat-milk latte, black, and an iced coffee. The taste and convenience cannot be beat and I’m hooked!",5
6944,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,12/22/2020,"My first Jot cup was love at first taste. I’ve broke my leg.Jot came to my rescue. Have you tried making a cuppa from a sitting position on a knee rover seat turned sideways?!? It’s not very easy to reach things. It was Jot that came to my rescue. It’s wonderful aroma, full body taste and certainly worth the value. I fired up my milk frother and went to town enjoying every last drop of Jot. I really went into overdrive with to spoonfuls of jot, warm milk and at packet of Swiss chocolate powder with marshmallows. Try it. You will get hooked too!",5
6945,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee (Trial),12/22/2020,"Purchased this as a birthday gift for my son, and he absolutely loves it!",5
6946,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee (Trial),12/22/2020,JOT has a slight fruity bitterness aftertaste. It’s basically the same syrup that restaurants use in the syrup coffee making machines. So what with with the high price? Awful expensive for a cuppa coffee I do not buy coffee at gas stations also a coffee shouldn’t cost two dollars!!! This is a product I would use occasionally not every day it’s too expensive I make a press coffee for virtually pennies that taste better than any instant or syrup coffee. If you are a cold coffee drinker this might be right up your alley you can disguise the bitterness with a slight sugar and creamer in a cold brew. Otherwise I’m not sure if I’ll ever purchased this again maybe as a back up coffee up in the tower crane. I assume that it needs to be refrigerated after opening??? I didn’t see any of that information in the package maybe I missed it. I don’t mind the bitterness aftertaste too awful much it’s basically a pretty good cup of coffee but definitely not the best. I do like the flavor better than most instant coffee‘s. I really wanted to like this but there’s just something about the flavor it’s not a real cuppa coffee to me.,3
6947,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee (Trial),12/22/2020,"Must admit I was a little skeptical because I roast my own beans as well as make my own cold brew concentrate in the summer which has made me a coffee snob when trying anything new. However, I’m a new fan because it’s pretty darn close and LOVE the smooth taste!  This will definitely be my backup!  Great job guys!!",5
6948,jot.co,Jot,Wonderland Ultra Coffee (Limited Edition),12/22/2020,I was worried at first how good it was going to taste just being able to add water or milk to a tablespoon of Jot. To my surprise it was delicious. We also have made many Holiday drinks with Jot as well.,5
6949,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee (Trial),12/21/2020,"I think I purchased two by accident... the original was purchased for my daughter... I can’t wait to hear her reaction.. I made some as soon as the second box came through... the aroma alone was ... Devine... I really think it’s the best coffee I’ve ever had!!! Incredibly, I kept smelling the yummy fragrance of fresh coffee even though there was only a tiny sip left in my cup!!! You guys are on to something big here! HUGE! ",5

",5
6951,jot.co,Jot,Wonderland Ultra Coffee (Limited Edition),12/21/2020,"I really enjoyed my first experience with Jot, although I do feel the price is a little steep for how many cups of coffee you get. I suppose you could make your cups less strong, and therefore have your bottle last longer, but where's the fun in that? Overall, the taste and quality were really good - just not an ideal price point for me.",4
6952,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,12/21/2020,Very caffeinated! A little too much for me. I’m going to try half tablespoon.,5
6953,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee (Trial),12/21/2020,"Finally got my coffee! Shipping services have struggled, but well worth the wait. No bitterness at all! I wish I had this years ago. I drank it iced, as I don’t like warm drinks and it was great. ",5

6958,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee (Trial),12/19/2020,"We are a strictly grind and brew household, I was actually surprised we even tried this. However, it is delicious and so great to have in the fridge when there is no time or energy to grind and brew. We both love the taste and convenience. Try it you will be most pleasantly surprised. Also great to have on hand when you only need one or two cups fast.
",5
6959,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee (Trial),12/19/2020,Had to triple the amount of coffee to where I liked it. My sister just used the 1 TBSP and it was ok for her taste.,5

6965,jot.co,Jot,Wonderland Ultra Coffee (Limited Edition),12/19/2020,I seem to have had trouble with the caps or corks? But I’ve tried once and it was good and very different in a good way. I like the simplicity of it and the bottle and the artist and artwork story that they sent. Very nice for the holidays. Sad the yellow mug gift set came out after but I’ll order that separately ,5

6981,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,12/17/2020,"So far so good.Got our Jot the other day and are starting to experiment. So far keeping it simple, but going to start working up to more complex drinks. Love the flexibility and adaptability of this product!

6987,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,12/17/2020,"Open a bottle of Jot. Take a deep breath. The aroma of quality is right there. Yes, this is quality coffee and far exceeds any Instant (perish the thought), Keurig of any variety, or Nespresso out there. It is perfect for travel. Now we are coffee snobs, grinding our beans immediately before brewing and then using only filtered water over fresh grounds with a few grains of non-iodized salt added. In contrast to my labor-intensive home brew, Jot is a bit more bitter (but far less so than any of the afore mentioned), and I use a bit less water than suggested in my Jot for a stronger cup. Next to me self-proclaimed award winning coffee, Jot is a close second. Remove that slight bitterness, and it might become #1.",4

I drank nearly half the bottle and immediately went back to the website to subscribe. The coffee is incredibly easy to make and it tastes great. It even smells great when you open the bottle. I feared it might be watery because you only add a teaspoon, but the coffee is consistently strong. I like lattes and cappuccinos so I’ve been warming up some oat milk and adding Jot to it and it’s so good! Now I don’t think I’ll even bother with getting a coffee machine because Jot is quicker, better and cheaper. I highly recommend!",5

I am almost always drinking fancy cold brews whether I make it at home or go to coffee shops. Much to the annoyance of my friends and family, I have a high standard when it comes to coffee so I was hoping Jot would at least be serviceable. Once I got a bottle of the Wonderland and standard Jot, I found out that Jot is more than serviceable, it's pretty great. Add in the fun bonus of ""doing the Jot"" for the first time and realizing it works really well (so well I wanted to post of a video of it on social media fully knowing I have no influence and would not be compensated for it). The standard Jot managed to please my hard to please girlfriend (who hates almost all coffee she tries) and myself. It does what it claims and then some. It's hard not to factor in the convenience during this pandemic as well. If you're like me and work from home even when things are normal, you're in the habit of going to coffee shops to break up the day. With Jot, you can get a great cup of coffee without risking face to face interaction. Even when this pandemic ends, I think the cost effectiveness of Jot is hard to beat for coffee snobs. Also props to the designers, amazing work!",5

The bottle might be tiny but since you're only using a tablespoon, you actually get more cups per bottle than any concentrate you can buy at the grocery store so Jot is not only a better tasting concentrate but its also a better value.

This is my first order. I tasted the Wonderland side-by-side vs the original. I first tried them straight at full 20x. They were both VERY strong. But neither was repelling or bitter. The Wonderland felt smoother, where the original felt very bright (like very dark chocolate). Then I mixed each with 8 ounces of water. The wonderland had a much smoother more well rounded taste. It had more noticeable ""mouth-feel"" or ""body"" to it. The original was good, not off putting - just more... basic. If I purchase again, it would be Wonderland for sure. The nutty/chocolate/vanilla notes do not scream by any means, but they really balance the cup and make it pleasing. I could drink Wonderland daily.",5

It has just the right notes to make a difference but nothing added that makes it artificial, sweet or overdone. Hints of chocolate and a little spice, very smooth (like the original).

Highly recommend!!",5

Knowing it was concentrated I diluted it the first time and only did 3/4 of the spoon and 8oz of water, but it tasted too watery that time. 

Second cup I did the whole spoon serving, 6oz of water and 2.5tbsp half and half and it was a good cup of coffee! 

I don’t think it’ll replace my other coffee choices all together, but I’ll buy again for the convenience & I am excited to try it as an ice coffee- I think that’ll be amazinnnggg.

My husband and I drink a lot of coffee - we make French press, cold brew concentrate, espresso from a machine and I have to say the Jot is my favorite! It is so convenient, and would be awesome to take on a trip so you don’t have to buy a coffee every day. Or, it’s just great to keep in your fridge when you don’t feel like grinding beans or having an espresso. Well done Jot, we’ll definitely be buying more.

7222,jot.co,Jot,Wonderland Ultra Coffee (Limited Edition),12/09/2020,"Tried both the new flavor and classic as a latte as well as just with hot water, both phenomenal but something about the Wonderland makes it extra cozy for winter. Caffeine-wise, only used half a tablespoon with a little less liquid for my own preference, and could still taste the flavor. ",5

I’m glad that I did. Their special holiday flavor, Wonderland, is my favorite with a warm vanilla taste. My only critique is that I feel some mornings that the one tablespoon amount is not enough kick. Overall, this coffee is something everyone should try.",4

7231,jot.co,Jot,Wonderland Ultra Coffee (Limited Edition),12/09/2020,I am very picky about my bottled coffees- I tend to grab whatever fancy cold brew Whole Foods has and mix it with oat milk :) But this is another LEVEL- it tastes like an expensive latte I get from my favorite local coffee shops. I highly recommend for a picky coffee friend or if you love a fancy coffee experience in the mornings. ,5

7236,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee (Trial),12/08/2020,"I bought this coffee for the ease of preparation, I drink coffee for the caffeine and somewhat for the taste, but usually I am like ""meh"" when it comes to actually liking the taste of coffee. My family and friends start the day with a cup so I do most days too, but unenthusiastically. When I tried this coffee, I swear I was like ""this is delicious!"" I was totally surprised! I thought to myself, this taste must be what other people love about coffee. I am not exaggerating when I say I literally love this coffee, and I did not want to. I thought it was too expensive. I thought I would try it and see if what they claim is true and then cancel, but man I love this coffee. And how easy it is...major bonus!",5
7237,jot.co,Jot,Wonderland Ultra Coffee (Limited Edition),12/08/2020,"Easy, great cup without all the fuss and machine costs. Better coffee than a Keurig, Nespresso or Starbucks. Jot rivals the best barista’s coffee with less cost. Get 2 bottles. One for home and the other for work.",5

I don’t have space for a good coffee maker, and I often get nauseous from percolated coffee anyway. I love jot for hassle free “americanos”. Very smooth, great flavor profile, and I don’t have to worry about time. I want more limited edition flavors. I think it would be really cool to try.

7267,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,12/04/2020,"I'm always hesitant when buying concentrates. I've found a few I like but nothing ever stuck. I also avoid concentrates usually since their packaging is so bulky and ultimately pretty wasteful if I buy one a week! 

I was super happy with the quality of this coffee!! The packaging is compact and I plan on reusing it for vases, other kitchen food storage, and anything else. It's super easy to portion with the given tablespoon tool and suggestions they have listed online, through social media, etc.

I'll be buying again for sure! :)",5
7268,jot.co,Jot,Wonderland Ultra Coffee (Limited Edition),12/04/2020,"I'm not a coffee-every-day kind of person. I generally prefer tea, but occasionally I do enjoy an iced coffee beverage. Which actually makes this almost a perfect product for me! It's incredibly convenient and has good flavor. I am especially enjoying the new limited batch of Wonderland. My only gripe is that it's very high in caffeine per serving, more than a regular cup of coffee. It gives me the jitters, so oftentimes I use just half of one tablespoon per beverage.",4

One of the biggest problems is the acid and the bitterness in a lot of the different coffees I’ve tried. JOT is smooth and delicious. It tastes like a cup I would get at top specialty coffee establishments. I love that I can put it in water and once in a while I’ll use it in a cup of hot nut milk as a treat. Super easy and so good.

7273,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,12/03/2020,I thought it's kind of a bit bitter for me but...👍,4
7274,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,12/03/2020,This instant coffee isn’t like the other competitors and I noticed a major difference in after-taste. This definitely will not give you the coffee breath in the office and your spouse will most likely send you off to the office with a kiss goodbye before you leave the house.The coffee has warm and very delicate flavor with all the fresh coffee aromas. The only drawback is that the coffee bottle didn’t last very long in my household of two. I would highly recommend for any coffee addicts and enthusiasts out there to try this – as it may surprise how great of a quality this coffee is being in the “instant” category.,5
7275,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,12/03/2020,I love how the footprint is so small including the shipping materials ,5

It's easy to add hot water at the hospital, easily keep it in my locker, and it still tastes great (unlike most older instant coffees that are powder). This tastes just like a cup of brewed coffee to me. ",4

7279,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,12/03/2020,"Your box came pretty beat up (thank you mail delivery) so all the nice packaging was pretty dented and scuffed on the outside. So now I had to decide whether to discard your box and wrap it in a generic box or use your messed up box with shipping label stuck to it but with all the nice logo interior stuff going on. See what I mean? I would also recommend that you have more literature in with the bottle, example- ""what do I do with this?"" or ""How do I use this?"" for someone getting it as a gift. They might not have a clue about your product. My two cents. BUT- I eagerly await their review and I have put Jot on my Christmas list- so I, too, will get to try your product.",5

I have so many different coffee making machines and devices and brands of coffee and pods and different grounds etc. but have yet to find that perfect cup of coffee without going to a coffee shop. THIS IS THAT PERFECT CUP! You can smell how perfect it’s going to be from the second you take the cap off the bottle. The aroma is amazing. I heated 10 oz of milk and added the coffee with the adorable little spoon that comes with the bottle, a little sugar for sweetness and bam! PERFECT! I’m literally obsessed. My daughter keeps begging me to make her a cup, but she can just keep drinking all the other stuff, this is mine! Don’t hesitate, buy it now, you’ll love it!!",5

7289,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,12/01/2020,"Overall I think Jot is a great substitute for a “normal” cup of coffee when I’m at the office and need a quick pick me up, where I don’t have a lot of fridge real-estate. I’ve enjoyed it both hot and cold and while I normally enjoy iced coffee more, I think the chemically taste is less noticeable as a hot coffee. It’s hard to get a shelf-stable bottled coffee that doesn’t have that chemical aftertaste and Jot does a good job at balancing flavor with efficiency.",4
7290,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee (Trial),12/01/2020,I stumbled upon Jot from the TraderJoesList and boy am I happy I placed an order. This really is one of the best cups of coffee I’ve had (esp from a little bottle). The taste is phenomenal for a ultra concentrate coffee - it has hints of chocolate (in my opinion) that I can’t get enough of. I’m addicted. :),5
7291,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee (Trial),12/01/2020,Jot packs an amazing smooth and rich coffee flavor. One of the folks I follow on Insta recommend it. I love rich coffees - thus far my favorite way to enjoy Jot has been as an iced latte. I am an espresso fan - the convenience of having an ultra coffee ready for me to blend with water or milk is simplicity and ease rolled into this bottle. Shared my Jot with a friend and am purchasing another to give as a gift. Definitely worth trying!,5

I do enjoy my French press on the weekend so but when I am at work Jot is super quick, convenient, and such a simple process with Co promising in quality or taste! It really is a miracle! I’m a fan! I am also already planning on bringing it along on any future trips! ",5

7322,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/26/2020,"I wrote to a friend that the packaging for Jot is 'sexy' and she didn't understand what I meant. I guess I'll have to find a way to make a better impression on her. Like, invite her for a cup of Jot -- consumed straight, to get to know it -- or incorporated in some combination with other things. I haven't sorted out the possibilities (well, with her, perhaps...).

My first impression was that I love the measuring spoon. It is delightful in weight and feel. I love the 'sexy' little bottles in the darling box. I don't understand the bunny logo. Maybe I'll tell her that it reminds me of the Playboy bunny; I'll let her sort that out.

I've only had one cup of Jot, and my first impression was that it will take some getting used to. It is not very strong (surprising, given the jet black bottles) but has undertones that I need to explore. Another cup is in order, I guess. Perhaps during the holidays I will give it some chances to get under my skin, and learn to appreciate it. I've been trying a number of new coffee options that are advertised online, and Jot was one of the only ones I thought suitable to try. So, I'll keep trying it and see what to make of it. It won't be my first cupajo in the morning (I need something stiffer) but it may be one of those cups for complex flavors that I like to have later on, mid-day.",3
7323,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/26/2020,"so far i’ve enjoyed it as an iced coffee, an iced latte, and cortado-esq. cant wait to play around with it more!",4
7324,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee (Trial),11/26/2020,"I was beyond excited to try Jot! I was referred by Trader Joe’s. First experience with almond milk was amazing the time to make it was the highlight. With a busy life and a fresh cup of coffee in the morning is the key starting my day that I can whip up in a few minutes. I love it way more with the almond milk versus water. I love dark strong coffee. Not sure if you will have a stronger option or even offer recipes for the strong lovers would be great. As I was not as excited once mixed with just water and vanilla creamer. Overall great and look forward to incorporating new options including oatmilk.

I have to say that it does taste like instant coffee because, well, it is. Lol. However, I will say that it is by far the BEST instant coffee I've ever tasted. It does not taste better than going to a coffee shop and it's not a replacement for my Nespresso machine, as some reviewers have stated, BUT it's a nice addition to my coffee bar for something a little different once in a while. As long as you don't mind the tart instant coffee flavor, you'll probably enjoy it. I loved the eco friendly packaging and excellent customer service I received though.",3

When I saw the buzz about Jot I had to give it a try and boy was I blown away by the incredibly smooth taste and notes of caramel and chocolate.

With this in the house, I’ll happily pass by a big chain coffee shop and come home and make myself a delicious cup of Jot...or joy😊",5
7432,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/21/2020,We really enjoyed this coffee! I love that I can adjust the strength of the coffee by adding more but not exactly adding MORE coffee.

7448,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/20/2020,"I remember first hearing about Jot in the summer through the branding agency Red Antler (since I’m a college student pursuing brand design). It’s one thing to visually look good as a brand, but to actually prove your product is just as good as you look is another—and Jot definitely proved that it’s possible. I don’t know why I waited just a few weeks ago to finally try it because, frankly, this is the best cold brew I’ve ever had, and I’m very picky with my cold brews. Since staying home more, it’s been hard to want to get myself out of the house just to satisfy my craving for an overpriced iced latte or cold brew. Now with Jot, incredibly smooth cold brew is right at my fingertips and is only a few steps into the kitchen. I love how you are still able to prepare however you want it, with the actual coffee being consistently delicious, making you want more than a cup a day—I can see why they offer the Double and Triple package deals. Not to mention, they are based in my homeland Colorado, giving me more reason to continue supporting local if it means high-quality coffee everyday. ",5

So easy and delicious. I would highly recommend!",5
7458,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee (Trial),11/20/2020,It’s really good flavor. I mix with four oz almond milk and four half and half and whipped it all together with a milk frother. I felt it didn’t taste as strong as normal coffee but I’m sure that is just because I used 8 oz of milk. It was delicious and a nice lazy way to have a cup of coffee without brewing!,5

7474,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/14/2020,I’m a huge cold brew fan and will try nearly every company I hear about.

This concentrate “Ultra Coffee”mixes so easily in hot or cold water, and the 200mL bottle stores easily in your cupboard or office desk drawer.Thanks again for this great product!",5
7486,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/12/2020,"I like the taste a lot. The convenience is amazing also. I am super glad for the included measuring spoon. I could easily over-consume this yummy caffeinated concentrate! (Lately my favorite is to have it for breakfast, flavoring my chocolate or vanilla protein drink. Delicious!)",5
7487,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/11/2020,"I am not a coffee drinker. Yah. I know.

Essentially, I have never liked the taste. Too bitter. The only kinds I did like were the mega expensive which coincides with calorie laden from the additives I would put in it to tame the coffee flavor. Really - end goal of drinking coffee that didn't taste like coffee?? Not really the coffee habit I need to add into my life or budget.

Fast forward: My friends and family love coffee and I wanted to find a unique gift to give during this years' covid Christmas. I love giving consumable items because I have reached the season of life.... when my family and friends want something.... they already have it because they purchase it for themselves. Research began. Enter in Jot. Ummm - after reading, ordering and receiving I felt the moral obligation and the need to try it for myself to see if it was all they said it was (as in) could it convert ""me"" (read 5 decades of no coffee despite multiple attemps by others to persuade me otherwise). 

Conversion experience accepted!! I am a new coffee drinker ~ a Jot coffee drinker. I love (love) the flavor. All I know how to say is this: it is so balanced or maybe the word is smooth? Best of all it is achieved without great effort; presenting few difficulties to enter into enjoyment and equally adjustable to whatever I want or what I don't want. It's not bitter to me but extraordinary in all the right ways. Insert a surprised but pleased look on my face. My daughter is a barista. She is all smiles. My family is smirking at me (what took you so long?) and my friends have accepted me into the happy place of the coffee collectives. 

Jot has sincerity in every cup.Yah, that sounds corny but I mean it. It has the quality of being free from the pretense, deceit, or a hypocrisy that my other coffee experiences have left with me. I'm told by others (the die hard coffee crews) who have tried it at my insistence ""it is loyal to the bean and more"". 

I am very excited to give presents this year! Jot presents. Thank you for reading!",5
7488,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/11/2020,"I am a huge coffee lover and have been trying to cut down on Starbucks. This absolutely does it for me and I couldn’t be happier with this product. I will be buying more in the future!!
",5
7489,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/11/2020,"I enjoy the taste of Jot, hot or cold. It's fast to make, with no annoying filters and other apparatus. However, it's expensive! For me, it's more of a treat than a daily thing.",5
7490,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/11/2020,"Jot is a revolution in the field of coffee- it has made my lattes even more easy, bad side I’ve started drinking more caffeine now! 😂",5
7491,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,11/11/2020,"My first impression was on how impressive the packaging and presentation design was. The box was so lovely, the spoon is very good quality, and the bottle quality and design is all beyond words. So I was blown away before I even tried the product.
The product itself is great. Again I love how meticulously everything is designed, so the experience of getting the right amount is not just easy but also surprisingly luxurious-feeling. I feel like I'm making a cocktail. The coffee was very good, even though I've only had a chance to try it twice so far (I'm still in the process of finding my favorite way of preparation so I can't elaborate here). I love the flexibility and my options though, because other than my no-fuss daily cup-o-joe, I have the option to mix things up a bit and use milk instead or use the concentrate as an espresso shot.
I'm utterly impressed with Jot on so many levels, in fact I am mentally tallying how many people I can give it to as a gift. If I had any negative feedback it would be that I find I need to put a bit over a tablespoon for my preferred strength, but that may be because my taste in coffee is quite strong. I would also love if you guys could provide more recipe ideas on your website or with each order, especially for those who don't have instagram.
Before I used to buy fresh beans and grind them each cup I made, but now I'm too lazy, so this is perfect for the coffee snob!
Absolutely fantastic! Good job you guys!

I used the Keurig for many years, but it was so weak. Then, I got a percolator, but it is a huge waste AND all I wanted was cold coffee. Takes so long and I never finish it all and it doesn't taste this good. Then, if you are a couple I'm 100% going to bet most of them don't like the same strength coffee. My parents make two different pots of coffee a day. Also, maybe some people want half decaf and half regular. Well, you can do both with this. If you are a tiny living person this is 100% THE SOLUTION. I literally take 5 seconds to get coffee exactly like I want it. I don't even have to use creamer with this coffee.

7562,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,10/27/2020,"I am _really_ enjoying this coffee. I am a big fan of the fact that ease of preparation was increased without having to sacrifice the high quality of the coffee. I think using a glass bottle for the packaging (vs. using plastic) makes sense because it provides the look and feel of a premium product for its users. And because of this glass bottle, it makes sense to provide users with an actual metal tablespoon. However, just like your team was able to improve the ease of coffee prep without sacrificing the flavor or quality of the coffee, is there a way to improve the ease of serving measurement (1 tablespoon/serving) without having to dilute the premium feel/look of the “premium”-ness of the product? Would using a still-somewhat-fancy plastic bottle with an attached fancy plastic tablespoon-sized-thimble (for fast and easy measurement) work while also driving down production costs? Just trying to throw an idea out there.

I only gave it a 4-star rating (out of 5) because I’m only halfway through the bottle and haven’t given myself the full opportunity to experience any pain points.

I’d be happy to follow-up and provide a full review once my bottle runs dry!

Thanks for the high-quality coffee service & product! Keep on innovating! I think you’re team is on to something! ;)

I guess you don't pay attention.
I already canceled the subscription.
Its quick, its OK, but its Meh.
Nothing special, plain.
Its smooth, but again nothing special.
I take the time to grind beans, weigh the beans, measure the temp of the water, weigh the infusion, so that I know I am getting the extraction ratio I want.
So for me to change to a different coffee, it better be a whole lot better than smooth, easy to make, but meh.

My wife loves it because she isn’t a huge coffee drinker, but if she has the urge, she can have iced or hot coffee at her desired strength in an instant.

It really does make drinks that are comparable to lattes, americanos, etc. from a cafe just about instantly. The taste of the syrup itself seems more like a really good strong cold brew concentrate than espresso. Definitely recommend.",5

Now that we're working from home I try to get as much sleep as possible and wake up at the very last minute I can. Jot allows me to do this because all I have to do is use a tablespoon of this, add oat milk, and sugar free sweetener (caramel pecan usually) and I'm ready to go. Jot gives me time to wake up, make my coffee, water my plants, catch up on emails, and then start my day. I think the taste is acquired just because I don't think any of us are used to a coffee concentrate but it is very smooth and easy to digest. I was super pleasantly surprised that I got such a quality tablespoon to use Jot with, that is such a nice gift and great bonus. I know that some people feel like they're overpaying for COFFEE of all things (Sbux anyone?) but you have to take a look at what you are gaining by buying this instead of having to wake up and make the coffee yourself. I feel that my ROI is great and I don't feel robbed of any money.

Living in a coffee town I fell victim to the peer pressure and have purchased everything it takes to make the perfect at home pour over, but given that it takes more than one minute, it’s been collecting dust for the better part of the year, while drive through coffee chains have been collecting my paychecks. Jot not only saved me major Benjamin’s but is also the quickest way I’ve been able to get my coffee fix (save for going straight IV).

I also notice they hide their reviews from the site and make another pop up come up when you try to click to read .. shady. Would only buy again if I got a discount.

I microwave a mug of water for a minute and a half, stir in some concentrate and I’m all set. If you like Americanos, this may be for you! However, if you lean towards enjoying a variety of roast flavors throughout your day or week, concentrate won’t be a complete solution. That said, on the variety front, I’ve used concentrate to make myself some lattes for the first time, and they were good enough that I am looking forward to trying a mocha. I’m not really a coffee snob but this definitely beats the instant coffee I’d been using and generally tastes as good as Starbucks, so I feel no need to go back to my expensive Sbux habit.

I add two TB to 16 ounces of almond milk and it is absolutely delicious. It is very smooth. It definitely has more caffeine than my latte, so I may have to reduce it to an 8 oz drink with only 1 TB, but I really like to enjoy a larger drink! I may end up getting a subscription to Jot.",5

The ability to make hot or iced coffee quickly that is strong but smooth and not bitter makes my coffee routine super convenient and the coffee is something I look forward to every morning. Plus, it may seem like a small thing, but the beautiful metal tablespoon that they include in the package is a really nice added touch! 
The only thing I might say that would be nice to see is that the number of cups in the 1 month package (ie 3 bottles) should have an option for 56-60 cups (ie so that 2 people can have a cup a day or 1 person who needs 2 cups a day can have enough for the month). At 42 cups it lands somewhere in between which makes me feel like I have to ration the amount used on some days so that I make it to the end of the month… If this could be changed that would be great!",5

Jot is the first liquid instant coffee I've tried. It has a pleasant bitterness and is complemented quite nicely with almond milk. This morning I had some on ice with almond milk and agave, and it was a lovely Saturday treat. Even my partner, a dedicated pour-over coffee drinker, enjoyed it enough to go for round 2.

On the other hand when added it to milk with a little sweetness I found it very pleasant. Ultimately I needed something to mask the super concentrated coffee flavor in order to enjoy it. Of course that sort of taste is highly subjective.",3

7844,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/24/2020,"The taste of Jot is very smooth, although not particularly flavorful.

7847,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/24/2020,"Branding, look and feel and product position in market is a genius move. No one else is really doing this nor have I experienced a finished product like this. It’s incredible the value market Jot identified with consumers. However, the product quality still has a long ways to go. Like any “increase strength” style coffee, they are suffering from acidity. It’s a crazy acidic product that lacks a smooth, nuanced experience. I’m not sure how Jot is producing this product to explain perhaps why this is the case. I’m also not sure if Jot defines the finished product from a sensory perspective as passing in terms of QC. So my perspective could be invalid. So, if you don’t like acidic coffees, Jot ain’t for you.

7848,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/24/2020,"Great taste. Slightly on the stronger side but fixed it by adding more milk and water. Slightly bitter but for a quick fix and on the go. This is the way to go.

After I received my bottle I just took 10oz of water and a little less than a recommended serving less, stirred it around a little and next thing I knew I found the coffee I would be content with drinking the rest of my life.

I found a decent quality one that tasted good enough but I still worried what harmful ingredients lurked behind the process of creating those conveniently instant coffee 'crystals'...but no more!

So I frothed up some milk and a splash of creamer, poured it 2 spoons of the liquid, and a dash of cinnamon. It was an interesting taste, not what I was expecting, but not terrible either.

7919,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/17/2020,"I was skeptical about Jot and hesitated purchasing it for a while because I assumed it was overpriced and would probably be weak and bitter, that it was just another low-quality gimmick. I finally bit the bullet-- darn that targeted marketing-- and I am not disappointed. If you follow the measurement directions, this stuff is like liquid gold. The taste is complex and bold and it makes throwing together an iced coffee in the morning before work a breeze. I know that it is somewhat pricey, but it ultimately saves me a ton of money over stopping into a local coffee shop and buying an iced latte, and it is just as good if not better. I would recommend every coffee lover at least give it a try!",5
7920,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/17/2020,This is exactly what I was hoping it would be! ,5

7924,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/16/2020,this coffee is amazing!!! the smell and the taste are amazing!!! I've found my new forever coffee!!!,5
7925,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/16/2020,There are a lot of reasons I love this product. The first and most obvious one is that I can go start to finish in 60 seconds and have a great cup of coffee. For this utility I would have sacrificed flavor but I didn't have to. It is in every way a rich and flavorful cup of coffee. I drink my coffee black just like my metal so there is no hiding how the raw product tastes. It also puts you in the driver seat as to how strong you want your coffee at that moment. If you you are familiar with the product and your caffeine tolerances then you may decide to put an extra splash of Jot in one morning or conversely you may want a lighter cup in the afternoon. It is nice actually knowing roughly how much caffeine I am consuming. Very big fan. Definitely plan to keep my subscription. Thank you Jot for being innovative in a very old industry.,5
7926,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/16/2020,"I have to say, other than tweeking the amount for my taste, it’s been fun trying this coffee...everyone thinks its just cold coffee, but I’ve had it both ways and thoroughly enjoyed it! I can’t wait to try it over some vanilla ice cream...oh and shipping was faster than a silver bullet! 😉",5

",5
7930,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/16/2020,I was a little skeptical to be honest. I didn’t think an instant coffee could be as rich and as flavorful as a deep French roast. Well I can happily say I was wrong. This is everything it claims and more. On a purely shallow level- it also can really well presented. It was the attention to the small presentation details that really cemented my 5* opinion.,5

We’re loving Jot!",5
7934,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/16/2020,Jot has absolutely changed my coffee life! It tastes so good and it’s so simple. I drink one cup a day now (down from 2-3 a day previously) and it’s saving me time and money. Thank you Jot!,5
7935,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/16/2020,My coffee is amazing every morning. Sucks to show up to work and have your home made coffee not be good/or weak in caffeine. But with Jot my coffee is great every single time. Jot has a new fan! ,5

7942,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/16/2020,Definitely amazing and worth to try. Tastes better with milk instead of water. But water gives you that americano taste,5

7945,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/15/2020,"I have a lot of familiarity with coffee, having been a barista for 5 years. I was initially skeptical of the premise of Jot; I had never seen anything like. I ordered my first batch on a limb to test it, and I must say I am presently surprised. It is incredible. Hot, iced, with water or milk, jot takes amazing, comparable to any coffee/latte you would get at starbucks/local coffee shop (and I like starbucks) for a third of the costs. Jot has replaced our coffee machine in my house as it simply tastes better. I've also found that richness works well in bake goods and as a marinade. 

There are a couple things to note:
1. This is VERY caffeinated, stronger than drip coffee, steeped iced coffee and espresso. Start off slow and see how you feel. I made the mistake of taking a whole serving the first time and got incredibly nauseous and stayed up to 3 am on a Thursday. Half a serving is enough for me.

2. I understand that the formula for making Jot is proprietary, but I wish they would share more on how they make it. I have a hard time explaining what it is to people who are interested and cannot attest to its ethical sourcing/organic nature/quality of beans etc.

All in all, would recommend.

Every other coffee concentrate I have tried has tasted pretty terrible, but Jot is better than most iced coffees you'd buy from most retail chains, though not as good as an actual specialty coffee place(which makes sense...).

7999,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/10/2020,"I’m a recent grad interviewing for jobs, and coffee has been not only part of my daily routine, but part of my perception of what it means to be productive, creative, and motivated. A couple things I love about Jot:

- It’s convenient. I’m always waking up 10 minutes before my Zoom meetings and have no time to make coffee.

- It’s stylish: really into the balsamic vinaigrette-like bottle. Feels luxurious. The box it came in, and the measuring spoon, were lovely. Also your website is cool.

- The taste is fire: so smooth. Smells amazing. Goes perfectly with oat milk. (I’m lactose intolerant.)

- So many use cases: I haven’t worked in an office since March, but I would’ve loved to have this in the fridge at my last internship, where it wouldn’t have taken up much space. Also, I almost broke the coffee machine in my first week, so you can imagine how much I need an idiot-proof solution. I can imagine making a mixed drink with this, putting it over ice cream/shaved ice, taking it with me on picnics that I plan but never execute on…

- It’s affordable. The subscription saves me money and saves me time selecting coffee and thinking about when to order. I also think it’s a huge strength that Jot only has one product, so customers don’t have buyer’s anxiety/paralysis.


Some product ideas/suggestions:
- Jot recipe book? People can submit photos, tag you on social media, and exchange their newest Jot creation that people can browse on the site (people already seem to do this in the reviews—talking about how much they use in their protein shakes and things like that)

- Some quiz or guide to tell me how much Jot is appropriate for my BMI or that I would need to achieve my desired level of heightened neuroticism. I will say that I have a really toxic relationship with coffee. If I drink coffee past 3pm, it’s game over. I’ve found it impossible to successfully toe the line between being alert and being over-caffeinated.

- Maybe reach out to big companies that might be interested in sending Jot to employees as part of a WFH care package, so they can actually have coffee for the coffee chats and company lunches they keep talking about but are really just Zoom calls…

- Don’t bury the reviews and email list in the hamburger menu sidebar. I would not have bought Jot without reading those reviews because it’s a little too mysterious for me from just the stuff on the landing page. Also, I think having a referral link for current Jot customers to send to friends (if it doesn’t exist already) will help build both trust and virality.

I think Jot has a lot of potential to become the next food/drink cult like Soylent/Huel. I can see this becoming popular with SV types if it isn’t already. Anyway, love Jot!!",5

Jot is as close to that espresso taste and mouth-feel as I've gotten without an actual espresso maker, which I can't afford / don't have the space for.

I am sure I will be taking Jot with me places that don't serve coffee (relatives) or keeping it on hand for those ""java-fix-now"" moments during the day! It is, also, the stuff of gifts for the coffee person on the go.",5

I am a Covid nurse and am beyond exhausted and do not have the time to go get an fabulous cup of coffee during my shift. Enter JOT. A solution that I did not believe possible. One taste and I am hooked. Whether JOT is mixed with hot water, a protein shake or milk you cannot beat the taste nor convenience that this amazing little bottle provides. Until my team members steal it. Help! Make a bigger bottle or a theft proof top. This nurse is exhausted. I am going to go lay down in a vacant room now. My liquid encouragement is gone. Boo. Send more please!

Sometimes I forget, though, and I wake up in the morning with none prepared. This is so convenient for those days! It is also great when I need just one cup in the afternoon or when camping. I haven't used it yet but I imagine it would be food for baking. Definitely great to have on hand.

8031,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee (Trial),09/09/2020,"First and foremost, I appreciate the fast delivery and the packaging of the product. On the day I had my first cup I expected it to be a bold taste, but what I got was different -- it was smooth and simply good. Once I realized how much I wasn't throwing out a K-cup nor cleaning coffee out of a French press, I liked the sustainability effort. My biggest drawback was none of my non-dairy creamers/milks seemed to not stir in smoothly. It tasted okay, but the appearance wasn't the creamy combined look I get when I brew other coffees. All in all I've enjoyed trying something different and it turned out to be a good experience.",4

8034,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/09/2020,I am obsessed with this coffee. It taste absolutely fabulous with just cream and sugar or mixed with flavored creamers. So easy to make.

Decent/Good coffee drinks have been mostly inaccessible since the COVID shut down. Found Jot through an ad on IG. Ordered a single and later the same day we received it, we got on a 3 bottle/mo subscription! My husband does Americanos; I doOatly iced lattes. Tha bomb.",5
8038,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/08/2020,"I liked the taste of Jot. I added it to milk, with no water, with ice and a sugar-free syrup flavoring (it's 114 degrees where I live). What i LOVED though was that I didn't get any acid stomach! I found it had more caffeine than I like, as I'm very sensitive to caffeine. It actually gave me the ""jitters,"" which I do not like or need. So I'm hoping you will develop a decaf option. Someone could buy the decaf version and mix with the regular version if they wished. As it is now, I have to drink it as early in the day as possible to be able to sleep that night.

For the subscription, I'd like more flexibility. I might not drink one a day. I'd be more likely to drink one a day if it was decaf. I really don't want the jitters on a daily basis. If the flavor of refrigerated Jot does not deteriorate significantly over 4 weeks, maybe I can use 14 servings a month.

Seniors downsize, often more than once, and have less and less space in a ""kitchenette"" for gadgets. So this is a great way to eliminate one. In fact, more people are choosing to live a minimalist life since space will be more costly every year for everyone. 

So: No or little acid; want a decaf version; more flexibility in subscription offerings.",4

Better than my fav coffee shop, just better in every way. I didn’t expect to like this product and now it is my new go to. I’m not sure how you do it, but I’m pretty sure it involves elves and I hope you don’t stop.

8066,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/07/2020,"I had been using a cold brew concentrate that was very high caffeine (equivalent to about a shot of espresso per ounce) but looked and tasted watery when it was diluted to a reasonable caffeine content. At one point I was unwittingly drinking over 500mg of caffeine in a 12oz coffee, and while it tasted great it was giving me migraines and interfering with my sleep. 

Jot is full and rich when diluted with 10oz of water (the instructions recommend 8, but that was a tad strong for my tastes), and it looks dark like coffee should. Jot claims 140-150mg of caffeine per tbsp of concentrate, which is totally reasonable as a daily intake, and a second serving would still be less than a lot of commercial coffee and energy drinks.

But the flavor! It's fantastic. It's not bitter at all, and although I prefer a little sugar, cream, and coconut or vanilla extract in my coffee, Jot is very enjoyable for me black. It's actually a bit tart, which is an unusual quality for coffee to have, but it's a mellow tartness that enhances the overall flavor. 

Anyway I like it a lot. If anything can improve, I just hope that in the future Jot will offer a few different types of brews just for variety's sake.",5

I absolutely love it iced with oat milk, and it does save me money and time since I can’t afford to go to my favorite cafe everyday. For hot drinks (just regular black coffee) I thought it was fine, not the greatest but it does the job. That being said I do believe it’s cafe-quality when iced and really enjoy

Despite its different form factor, I expected to be burned by yet another awful tasting instant coffee but instead I was actually really surprised by how easy and good coffee is when made with this little bottle! I give four stars as I feel it tastes better in cold coffees over hot drinks. Everything from the packaging it is shipped in to the taste of the coffee itself is high quality. Will be ordering again!",4
8104,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/05/2020,"I had no idea it was going to be this amazing. First of all, it has the best taste. I make iced coffee every day with this now. Nothing better. It’s also stronger than most of the huge iced coffee containers you get at the store. Oh!! And takes up a fraction of the space in my fridge!!! Great price too for how many cups you get. Obsessed and already have told friends about Jot!

8108,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee (Trial),09/05/2020,I am not a huge fan of the coffee made with just hot water and Jot but using equal parts heated water and evaporated milk with Jot is an easy homemade Latte,5

8112,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee (Trial),09/05/2020,"I was doubtful but also hesitant to spend the money. But after a full week of Joy every morning and it taking 30 seconds to make, and being delicious with a whole half bottle left, I’m pretty sold!

8113,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/05/2020,I wasn’t sure I would like Jot but it was worth a try. I discovered that I love this product so much.

8116,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee (Trial),09/04/2020,"I like a lighter coffee flavor, so I mix a tablespoon with 5 to 6 cups of water and refrigerate. Then, I mix 8-10 oz of this homemade iced coffee with creamer and ice and I'm set. I just love it!",5
8117,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/04/2020,"as a coffee snob myself, I cannot say enough about how amazing JOT is! It tastes like it is from your favorite local coffee shop!

8123,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/04/2020,"Like most coffee lovers, I was pretty skeptical about Jot. When I got the ad, I thought I would just scroll by it like the rest. But then I kept watching and saw how easy it was. And with the heatwave coming I knew I needed another alternative for cold coffee drinks other than just the cold brew I was making at home. So I figured I could give it a try and simply cancel if I didn't enjoy it. However I was pleasantly surprised and no longer cancelling. In fact- I adjusted my subscription sooner because I need MORE! So far my fiance and I have only made almond milk lattes and iced coffees but I am looking forward to more fun concoctions. And the ease, convenience, taste, and per cup cost is unbeatable. I did the math, and it's very close to the per cup cost of my homemade cold brew. Next week we are going on a quick Getaway cabin trip and look forward to bringing Jot along! Cheers!",5
8124,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/04/2020,"The entire Jot package is of utmost quality; from opening the box to taking your last sip, everything is a superior experience.

I’m an iced coffee drinker so making my own and then icing it becomes a hassle and it gets diluted. The first day I used this, I stopped hitting the coffee stop in the morning. I immediately went back into the site and ordered two bottles on a subscription. This stuff is delish!!",5

8136,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/04/2020,the coffee is okay but a little bland. it tastes good with milk (sweet) but with water it's very sour and not strength enough -- following their instructions of 8oz of water.,3

Jot is by far the most convenient option I’ve found that is strong enough and tastes good!

8147,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,09/04/2020,"I have enjoyed the coffee very much so far. I am six cups in and love making a latte the most. The latte by far has the best flavor. A normal cup of coffee (with hot water added only) does not taste as good as my normally brewed coffee, but my normal cup of coffee cannot be made as quickly. 

I think that it would also be nice if you had more recipes available. Like some kind of menu of your favorite lattes or how to make the best cup of coffee, etc would be awesome. I know you have some of this on your website but it’s pretty limited. I also think you could add what type of alcoholic beverages go well with this.

The simplicity and ease of using the product is by far the best selling point. But I would love to see the price drop a little bit, and see a menu of all sorts of different recipes specifically geared towards Jot.",4

One late night I stumbled across Instagram post for Jot, thought to myself ""this is different and I haven't tried it"" so I gave it a go. WOW! I actually look forward to my coffee so much more everyday and when I drink it I am transported to a beautiful place. I absolutely LOVE this coffee. It is significantly better than any cafe or coffee shop around. And I can make it at home. Is it cheap, no! But nothing great ever is. Is it worth it? ABSOLUTELY!!! Wow. Wow. WOW!",5

Cold milk, a splash of flavored creamer, and a tablespoon of Jot, throw in some ice, stir and it's so good!

My partner did as instructed but felt that it was too watery. So after playing around with the ratios, my partner found something that worked for him. He loves his coffee black, very black and doing 1 1/2 worked. Personally, I have sensitivity to coffee and become easily tense and anxious (I'm looking at you Starbucks, shame on you and your awful coffee) so doing 3/4 worked really well for me. The taste is smooth, delightful, and refreshing (oddly enough). It's quick to make too.

I think the only thing I can critique is that it advertises as '20x more concentrated than traditional coffee' but I'm not sure that actually means anything in retrospect.........if my partner had to add 1/2 more to his cup, perhaps it wasn't doing enough compared to his normal coffee choice of Philz. Price wise it's a little frustrating because you're using more in one cup for the value of the bottle which is estimated at 14 cups.",5

I drink out of a 24 oz cup. Even with just using two spoons full for each cup, it didn't last me a week. Some days I have two cups of coffee so that's four spoon fulls a day. That's going on the lighter side of things. If I wanted to do the full three spoon fulls, it would of went quicker. I just thought this would cut my need to go to Dunkin or starbucks everyday, but it would actually be cheaper to buy 2-3 coffees from them every day than buying not every 5-7 days.

I tried Jot on a friend’s recommendation (who also loves coffee and drinks it in similar quantities). It’s amazing and better than what I’d get out. I’ll no longer need to take away and have already saved the money I would have spent. My only issue is restraining myself from having more and becoming overly caffeinated. Very pleased.

8251,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/28/2020,"The flavor of this coffee is smooth, but by no means weak tasting. I typically drink black coffee, so it is important to not have a drink that needs to be covered up by sugar and cream. I love that I don’t need to use a wasteful (and usually meh) pod to get an easy single serving. It also works great for my personal favorite treat: Mexican Coke with a shot of espresso over ice.

I was wasting a ton of money going to local coffee shops for my daily iced latte or cold brew, and efforts to make my own versions of these drinks at home were time consuming and expensive. I’ve tried so many brands of coffee and even bought a water filter just so I could use filtered water in my coffee at home, and I still couldn’t make anything that lived up to my local coffee shops. Enter Jot. First of all, it’s delicious and so smooth. Definitely tastes more like a cold brew than an espresso, which I actually prefer. Second, I cannot stress enough how easy it is!! If my exhausted, 5-hours-of-sleep self can do it, you can too! Third, it doesn’t make my breath smell like I forgot to brush my teeth like other coffee does sometimes. Yes, it’s a little more expensive than other brands of coffee out there, but it’s less expensive than going out for coffee every day and the flavor and convenience factor makes it worth it!!

I use Torani chocolate sauce (about 1/2 tbs) mix well with the 1 tbs of jot, 1/2tbs of caramel sauce with some sea salt and then add 16 oz of almond milk with ice. It is so good!

I am a iced coffee drinker, even in the Chicago winters.
A lot
Of the cold brews or nitro coffees are bitter, not Jot.
Very smooth, I am a coffee with cream drinker, but I can even drink Jot black.
First day I got it I made a iced coffee with cold foam

Thanks Jot!",5
8305,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/26/2020,Pretty simple for a solid cup. Not bitter like normally concentrates. ,5
8306,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/26/2020,I may never go back to drip coffee. I'm a busy physician and mixing this with a cup of water eliminates my 5 minute ground coffee routine every night. It's a lifesaver.,5
8307,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/26/2020,Few quick coffees can match the true awakening of senses that a coffeeshop fresh brew can deliver. Jot really creates that awakening in your very home!,5

8309,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/26/2020,"This coffee gives a new meaning to “instant coffee.” The term no longer pertains to something powdered, processed, and second-rate. Not with Jot! To be honest, I had my doubts as to whether a spoonful of liquified coffee beans could warrant all the great reviews. But those doubts were washed away by the deep, complex notes that made me so happy with each sip! Not to mention the luxurious packaging of the entire product. I feel spoilt. Almost guiltily so. If you’re thinking about it, just give it a try!",5
8310,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/26/2020,Pretty cool and convenient way to have coffee. I personally enjoy lighter roasts but still very good. Are different varieties / roasts in the pipeline?,4

8312,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/25/2020,I wasn't expecting much when I first ordered Jot. I saw it on an instagram post and bought it because it looked worth trying to see how far we've come. Needless to say I was blown away and used it every day and shared with everyone till I ran out. I do wish that it wasn't as small as it is. I liked using a tablespoon and a half because I like really strong tasting stuff but it ran out too quickly which is the only reason I gave 4 stars vs 6 stars.,4
8313,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/25/2020,"Very simple to make and tastes better than a dunkin latte, could not ask for more",5

8316,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/25/2020,If you want a quick ice coffee or a hot coffee these little bottles are so convenient. I usually use two Tbsp for my iced coffe with almond milk and water and a little creamer flavoring and a healthy serving of ice. Great idea!!,5
8317,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/25/2020,"What a great discovery during the pandemic! Super simple, just pour into the included spoon (a nice scoop, though bends too easily IMO) and pour in some cold water or water with ice for a cold brew. Pretty good, rivals many bottled or chain cold brews. Excited to try to make other types of drinks with this. The ease of use definitely makes it worth the cost, which is surprisingly affordable given what it is. I just might retire my Ninja machine.",5
8318,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/25/2020,This is hands down the best coffee I have ever had! Thank you Jot!,5

8321,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/25/2020,"I bought a bottle of Jot primarily because of the novelty of the product and intended to use it mainly to cook with. When I received my order, I was very impressed with the packaging and the included measuring spoon. However, I would have gladly taken the bottle wrapped in a brown paper bag if it meant that the overall cost would be lowered.

My first use of the product was in an iced coffee which I found to be very tasty and on par with what I could get at a restaurant. The next morning I made a hot cup of coffee with it and found the end result to also be quite good. In fact, the only problem I have with Jot is the price. The cost works out to be $1.71 for an 8 oz. cup of coffee ($24/14). That is a mighty steep price for something I am making at home while sitting around in my pajamas! I can get a fine 16 oz. cup of dark roast joe at Panera for $2. That's twice as much coffee for almost the same price!

I will use Jot in my cooking exploits but when the bottle runs out I doubt I will be buying another. I just can't justify the cost.",4

You will not be disappointed! I love my coffee...anywhere from 2 to 6 cups a day depending on the day...it's 2020 so you can see where my caffeine consumption's been at lately. BUY IT! I've only drank it iced, but it's delicious. I need to buy some oat milk so I can make myself a latte. If I could give it 10 or 20 stars I would!",5

Coffee is not a luxury, it's a necessity. However, the crazy amount of sugar and and artificial ingredients in my go-to Starbucks can plus the outrageous price had me looking for a solution.
I saw Jot and thought . . . why not? I ordered the two pack (free shipping) and I tried it with my best Mom friend. We were hooked, so much so that I gave her the second bottle.
Here's my secret for excellent iced coffee - 1 tablespoon flavored coffee sugar - cover with bottled water and heat in microwave until the sugar dissolves. Add 1 tablespoon Jot and stir well. Add 8 ounces of milk and pour over ice!! 
I'm converted. It's my new morning routine!",5

Occasionally, we appreciate high quality organic coffee like a few times a month or so and that's about it. One day, I came across a video of JOT on social media and for some reason I couldn't resist so I ordered it. My husband was skeptical when I told him about it. We had 3 bottles so far and I feel like we both are addicted to JOT now!",5

Enter Jot. My morning coffee now takes me about 10 seconds. Pour in jot, almond milk, sweetener and ice. Done. It tastes exactly like good iced coffee and I didn’t spend $4.95 and 20 minutes in the drive thru line. I love it. I feel like it was made for people like me.",5

I’ve been starting all my days with almond milk iced lattes based on this delicious, full-bodied coffee. Pro tip: add a sprinkle of cinnamon to bring out the flavors even more!

I have not been able to find coffee as great since being back in America. I can say that JOT is the closest I've come to re-living my coffee experience in Australia. It is smooth, strong and delicious. You won't be disappointed.

1. Great quality and taste
2. Compact size fits anywhere perfectly in my fridge.

Prior to this I was buying big bulky cold coffee bottles. No more. Tons cheaper than coffee shops, but taste great!!",5
8402,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/20/2020,"I ordered Jot in an attempt to make my mornings easier as well as save money by not going out for coffee so much. I am SO glad I gave it a shot!

",5
8405,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/19/2020,"I almost bought this stuff a few times, then exited the page for whatever reason. I can honestly say I love Jot. I make a morning protein drink every day that I usually put coffee in and Jot has made it easier and better tasting. The first day I had my stuff I drank 3 cold brews because it was delicious and easy. I do not recommend doing this as I almost ran through my basement wall soon after.

5/5 stars - will absolutely be a staple for me. I haven't had it with hot water yet, but if it's half as good, I'll be selling my coffee maker.",5

8408,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/19/2020,"I'm very used to drinking shots of Cuban espresso, which is super high in sugar and pretty bitter if not done right. I tried this on a whim and I'm totally in love. Feels much stronger than a cuban colada with a lot more customization. Tastes so good, I don't get a whole lot of bitterness either. 

Here's my favorite drink to make right now:

Oatmilk Iced Mocha

1 tbsp Jot
1 oz water
3 ice cubes
1 oz Agave Nectar 
Fill with dark chocolate oat milk",5

I purchased Jot for 4 drinks: Smoothies, Iced Coffee, Frozen Blended Coffee Drinks, and Coffee Martinis. Simply put, Jot is AMAZING for all of those uses. I don't personally like it as a hot coffee beverage, but if they started offering specific roasts and regions from which I could choose, I imagine that would change. But, since it's awesome for what I wanted it for, 5 stars.",5

Oh boy, what a step up Jot coffee is. It gives an amazing smooth coffee taste. I tried black coffee and latte, both hot and with ice. It's super easy and quick to prepare, and was such a delightful experience to drink. Thanks for making my day more productive and my WFH experience more enjoyful!",5
8419,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/18/2020,I recently tried JOT coffee for my first time a few days ago and absolutely love it! .. I have a cup over ice with almond milk daily and it’s absolutely DELICIOUS! .. Highly recommend! 🖤,5
8420,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/18/2020,"I was skeptical about this concentrated coffee for replacing my beloved cold brew and other iced coffee delights, but I was sick of the time expenditure to make it myself or the money expenditure to buy it almost daily.

8425,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/18/2020,From the first drink I made with Jot I was hooked. I’ve been sharing with coworkers and friends about Jot and even passed along info how to order! I’ve made a couple posts on my fb page sharing how I love it. I’ve pretty much done everything except shout from the rooftops! It’s great! I like mine in cold milk. 😀,5
8426,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/18/2020,Jot coffee is so easy! Just add a spoonful or so to water & ice and you have delicious cold brew. Took me a few tries to get the water/coffee ratio just right but then smooth sailing.,5
8427,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/18/2020,"Love how easy this is without any compromise to quality and taste. The more dense liquid also gives way to some creativity like adding it into baking or ice cream, can’t wait to try some recipes.",5

8430,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/18/2020,I am a huge coffee lover and was definitely intrigued by the idea of Jot.

8431,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/18/2020,I am having fun experimenting with Jot in both hot and cold drinks. Makes a great iced latte with foamed milk. I still don’t have the proportion quite right for a cup of black coffee; 8 oz hot water is not quite enough for my taste. Strong but not bitter.,5

8437,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/18/2020,Coffee has a much more interesting taste than the cold brew concentrate I was previously using. Also less room is used in my refrigerator since these Jot bottles are much smaller.,5
8438,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/18/2020,I like the convenience of brewing a quick cup. Since I prefer a strong brew I use one and a half tablespoon. Taste is very good. Would like to know the origin of the beans used to produce this product.,5

My boyfriend and I were impressed with just how ultra this ultra coffee is. Today is just my second day drinking Jot, and I think I'm already hooked!

This seemed to be a much cheaper and easier alternative. I started experimenting a little and in a blender I'll throw in 1tbsp of jot, 1tbsp of water, a bunch of ice, 3/4 cup of milk, some sweetener or simple syrup, and bled it all together. Pour over some ice, top it with some whip cream and I have a REALLY easy homemade frap in literally about 2 minutes. Which is actually so amazing. Seriously. It's so good. I never need to go to Starbucks ever again.",5

Well it worked. I loved the packaging so much I though, why not give it a shot? I’m so glad I did. This is actually the best cup of cold brew I’ve had in ages! When I was in Japan I got really addicted to their semi sweet “milk coffee” and couldn’t find anything like it in the US that was still a bold cup of Joe but not syrupy sweet. One tablespoon of JOT in 8oz of Cashew milk is HEAVEN! You’ve gotta try it! It’s really that good.",5

8496,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/13/2020,My friend recently told me about Jot and I wish I had bought it sooner. It’s so delicious! I’m definitely going to sign up for the subscription - I can’t imagine my mornings without it!,5
8497,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/13/2020,"On our second shipment after receiving the first 3-pack as a gift. This is the perfect pandemic afternoon coffee fix. In the morning we make our own espresso drinks, bu my wife and I always had an afternoon coffee out at a café as our afternoon routine. Now we can do a quick iced coffee with jot

Why not 5 stars? If they offered different flavor profiles or concentrates of branded craft coffee roasters it would be truly top-notch. Also, while it makes a great iced coffee, I don’t care for using it with steamed milk in place of espresso",4
8498,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/13/2020,"The taste of the coffee is very similar to specialty coffee. While it may not be the best of the best that beats fresh espresso, it contains a lot of similarities and is above average most other coffees I've tried. For example, if you were to try an espresso from a rookie barista using the top quality beans, Jot would probably beat that. The only thing is there won't be crema like regular espresso, but the flavor is astounding.",5

8519,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/12/2020,Jot is a bit pricey but really good when 1/2 tsp is added to a regular cup of coffee. Tastes much like Dunkin Doughnuts Americano. Just what I was after.,5

8523,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/12/2020,"The concept and convenience are 5 stars. The coffee itself is more just ok. You have competitors that make better coffee with worse convenience (Cometeer is the example in my mind - they have the best coffee but it comes frozen in pods so you have to defrost it). 

Don't get me wrong - Jot's not bad, but its comparable more to the coffee you get at an old school bakery with a friendly Nana who is doing her best to keep up with the coffee game. Cometeer is on the level of like these modern faux-rustic-chic coffee shops with ""ethical"" coffee and a pool table and a bunch of people writing short stories.

All in all I think I will continue to use Jot because it is useful for me to make iced coffee quickly at home, but I would not use this in the winter because I think I can make better hot coffee myself. Also I might switch back to cometeer while I work from home because it takes like 5 minutes to defrost it and honestly I have the time.",4

My favorite method is using 10-12 oz of iced oat milk instead of the recommended 8 oz to keep it on the lighter side (personal preference). Trust me, this little spoonful of coffee is STRONG (in a great way!). The only downside for me is the price point. However, I've found that the mere efficiency of this product makes it worthwhile, and it's still cheaper than a coffee shop. This is one of the few products I have committed to treating myself with!

I took her advice and it has been amazing. Jot has a clean, rich, and smooth taste. And it is so easy to make a quick cold or hot drink with, that it’s been perfect for our trip and keeps us from stopping for sub-par coffee on the road. I will definitely keep a bottle at home now as well for a quick fix without the hassle of grinding and brewing to make a cup of coffee. 
The flavor of Jot is really, really, good! So I don’t feel like I am compromising quality for convenience when I choose Jot for a cup.

Caffeine concentration was a little on the higher side for me, so I would like to see something less strong as well but similar in taste. Will keep ordering though.
",5
8572,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/10/2020,"I have used this coffee with warm milk, warm almond milk, and as affogato with milk and ice cream. The taste of this coffee is really great and it is very convenient. However, I do have a few issues:

1. I don't know where this coffee was from at all, and whether they are blend or single origin, and what country and kind of coffee beans it is. The website gives very little info about that.
2. Very little info on the website about how it's fairtrade, and who you partner with for the beans.
3. The cork doesn't close nicely and pops out occasionally from the bottle in the fridge.

Overall, I like this coffee a lot, but will consider asking for a refund if there's no more info about the source of the coffee. My girlfriend who ordered this for me said it's fairtrade and I didn't realize there's so little info beyond the website's tiny 3-sentence blurb saying it is organic fairtrade. Since you're a small company producing small batches, I would expect those info to be easily found and openly published; not having it actually raises even more suspicion on your practices. Please consider having more info about your coffee beans on your website. Take a lot at this for comparison: https://www.olamspecialtycoffee.com/

Less than a week into using Jot, I’ve gone through my first bottle and eagerly awaiting my next scheduled delivery. Compared to the space it takes to brew your own cold brew, this is a no brainer. Great for travel, keeping at work, or using at home on those work from home days where you never leave your house. Can’t recommend more highly.

8633,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/06/2020,"I’m a little ridiculous with my coffee spending habits. I have my favorite coffee shop in town- $5 for an iced latte with oat milk + tip. The cost adds up quickly, obviously. I’ve tried to make iced lattes at home and the coffee either tastes weird or it’s watery. But THIS. This is it. I add one spoonful of Jot, 8-10 ounces of oat milk, and .5 ounces of Holy Kakow vanilla syrup. It literally makes the perfect iced latte. The taste is rich and smooth, and it doesn’t water down the oat milk. I’ve read reviews where it’s compared to cold brew, but to me it’s more of espresso with just a hint of cold brew taste. It makes a creamy, flavorful, strong latte. When you include shipping into the overall price, as well as the cost of milk, you’re only saving a few bucks per cup compared to a coffee shop. But those few dollars add up, so it’s worth it for me.",5

I've tried overnight cold brew steepers, freezing coffee in ice cube trays, and the expensive jugs of cold brew from the grocery store.

Best combination so far was the best white Russian I’ve ever made or have had in my life!",5
8695,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/04/2020,"purchased jot for my iced coffee/cold brew loving husband, ended up drinking it once a day with him. we’re big fans! it doesn’t pair well with hazelnut creamer (our default) but perfect with some simple syrup and a splash of oat milk. *chef’s kiss*",5
8696,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/04/2020,"I have been using Jot the past week and a half and will have 1 serving around lunch time that will usually power me through the day. No jitters, great tasting and no crash after from my experience. If you’re a coffee drinker, you’ll love Jot.",5
8697,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/04/2020,"Was so impressed with the quality - balanced and super flavorful. It tastes just like a latte I would get from a cafe. It’s pretty concentrated so I generally end up putting ~10 ounce oat milk plus ice for a tablespoon of Jot.

Big upgrade from my nespresso machine!",5
8698,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/04/2020,This is exactly what I’ve been looking for. I kept seeing Instagram ads and I was hesitant to try since I love the coffee beans I use but jot tastes like a freshly brewed cup without the work of having to brew a shot and wait for it to cool for my ice latte. I absolutely love! ,5
8699,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/04/2020,I just bought 3 bottles of jot. The coffee tastes really good so I would say the quality is there. I do like my coffee very strong So if you are like me you might need a speck more than 1 tabl. I have to have my coffee before leaving work so it is time saving. I love not having coffee grounds. It’s not cheap but if you get the 3 bottles at a time there is a good discount.,5
8700,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/04/2020,I was skeptical that this would improve my coffee having experience. It really has. Super easy process for a $5 taste.,5
8701,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/04/2020,"I'm not sure what kind of magic is stuffed inside these cute little bottles, but magical it is. I make mostly oat milk lattes and occasionally I'll pour it black and I look forward to it every morning. I can't wait until I get dangerous and decide to put it on some icecream.

All that aside, I'm really a huge fan of the environmental considerations. It's not possible for me to compost in my area, so beans tend to feel wasteful, and I just hate purchasing coffee in yet another plastic container. These little bottles are extra recyclable even before they hit the recycling center!

Thanks for a great product!",5

Adding the coffee to water for black coffee is probably the ""worst"" form of Jot (although it's still good!), but it really shines when you try to make a latte. It seems to separate less if you make it hot by boiling it then letting it cool rather than making it cold. I wish I could give a 4.5/5",4
8705,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/04/2020,great tasting and extremely easy to make. I use it with all types of milks and creamers. Can't go wrong!,5

Highly recommend!",5
8724,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,08/03/2020,I purchased Jot because I love lattes but don't have space or time for an espresso machine. I was also looking for something easy to make since I recently had major surgery. Jot has not disappointed! 1 tablespoon gets you an 8oz latte for roughly a $1.50. I use oat milk and homemade lavender simple syrup to recreate my favorite coffee house latte. I feel one drink of Jot gives me enough caffeine to go about my day without being jittery. I'd love to see the line expanded to different roasts and caffeine levels.,5

I can quickly make a coffee drink at home without going through the fuss of brewing, grinding, waiting for drip, icing it down, etc. The only thing I will say is that the coffee has more of an acidic note than I prefer, but that’s a personal taste thing.

What can I say? The product is a game changer. From the marketing to the website to the packaging, the experience is simple and elegant. In regards to the product itself, man oh man is it delicious.

Thanks,

He isn’t a morning person and typically takes (what I perceive as) days to wake. I ordered Jot as a surprise for him in the hopes that it’d make his mornings a little better. He absolutely loves it! Not only does he think it’s incredibly smooth and tasty, it gives him enough of a morning jolt to get our babes to school and himself to work on time! I’m excited to try it myself when I get home. We will be subscribers!

I use more water than the recommended amount and it’s still strong at 12 oz. Great flavor also. Not too bitter. Very aromatic. It comes in a very fancy box with a metal measuring spoon and some recipe suggestions. I have made an affogato desert, cold brew with sweet cream (like at Starbucks), and a mocha using hot milk and chocolate syrup. With the average cold brew drink being about $5 for a glass, this is a good deal.",5

Now on to the product itself, as an avid iced coffee drinker - I found it to be ""meh"" - the flavor profile was somewhat silky and left my mouth feeling coated? Maybe it's a preference thing but I prefer my iced coffee to feel more refreshing and have a bite. 

I will still recommend JOT to my friends because I believe in small business and understand how complex taste buds can be - but I wanted to let you know i'll be keeping an eye out if there's ever a recipe change I'd give it another shot! 

Hope this wasn't rude, I just know I prefer honest feedback

8802,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/29/2020,"So it’s a little cheaper than buying a coffee every day, but the real tea is that it’s so fast to whip up a cup, Or even just take a some as a shot if you’re REALLY in a hurry and need the jolt, that spending the money on faster coffee and more versatile cooking/mixing options is stellar. It tastes great too. No issue with flavor profile at all",5

The packaging and spoon made me think it would make a fun gift. Since it is so concentrated, I was surprised to find as much sediment as there is at the bottom. Still, worlds better than my best attempts at homemade concentrate. If travel were still a thing I think I would lament the sexy and impractical stopper as opposed to a screw top, but it does have an excess of style.",4

You can make any permutation of your favorite coffee drink and enjoy premium, smooth, and rich flavors from just a splash of this ultra concentrated goodness.

8825,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/28/2020,"As a coffee snob in Portland, OR, I am pretty particular about my coffee. Jot isn't going to replace my aeropress or pour over coffee at home. But it definitely saves me from buying premade cold brew. And it's perfect for the day's I'm running late and don't have time to make coffee before work. 

Of the quick, easy, low effort, or ""instant"" coffee options out there, Jot is probably my favorite. It actually tastes like coffee, rather than some weird approximation

I opened the bottle and the coffee smelled amazing. I made my first cup using ice, milk, and the recommended tbsp of Jot. I like my coffee on the stronger side and it was perfect. I've started adding a bit of maple syrup for a little sweetness and it tastes like something I would buy from a coffee shop, but for way less effort and money per serving. Highly recommend!",5

I love how I can control how strong or weak every cup is, rather than being stuck with an entire pot, and the taste is pretty great! Packaging was fantastically recyclable and very snazzy! Wasn’t expecting an accompanying measuring spoon but was VERY happily surprised! My only complaint (and it’s not really much of a complaint/I don’t know if anything can be done) is the way the measuring spoon is held in the box. It’s secured using a rubber and that I didn’t notice and accidentally bent the spoon when taking it out. 

Overall, Joy is reasonably priced and tastes great!

8845,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/28/2020,"I was excited when this popped up on my Instagram because I always enjoy trying new coffee! The taste and presentation of the coffee was a 8/10. I enjoyed drinking it because it was fun to pour in and looked really nice. However, it didn’t taste that much different from my normal cold brew. The only difference was that it was more “fruity” if that even makes sense for coffee :) I also like the convenience factor of this coffee! It made my morning go a lot quicker! Price was a 5.5/10. It didn’t break my bank for my one order, but I probably won’t be getting a subscription, and will probably only order once in awhile. If you guys knocked down the price just a little, and maybe sold in cases of 5-10 bottles, I think this product could do really well. I don’t know if this sells in stores, but if I was walking in Target, I’d be way more likely to buy it then having to buy it online and pay shipping on top of it!

The taste is on par with anything we’ve made at home and better. ,5
8881,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/26/2020,"At first I was skeptical about this, because I’m used to the strong dark espresso roast that comes straight out from my machine. I don’t know how exactly this technology works, but I love the clean concentrated taste of the coffee. I’m not a coffee drinker but an espresso drinker. The best part of JOT is that it saves time for me in the morning. Whether I want a hot or iced oat latte / americano it blends SO WELL with oat milk. I tricked my parents saying it was from Blue Bottle & they believed it. They even said it was deeper & richer in taste. The stainless steel tablespoon that it comes with is brilliant. Overall, it’s satisfying and convenient. I can’t believe it’s organic coffee (espresso). I highly recommend JOT to those espresso drink lovers! ",5

In a conscious effort to reduce waste and save money, I decided to try a Jot subscription. I’m almost through my first bottle, and I can honestly say it’s some of the best coffee I’ve ever had and the best part is that I can make it at home.

",5
8924,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/24/2020,"This coffee has been a saving grace. I’m obsessed with iced/cold brew coffee and have been going to Dunkin/Starbucks since 2011. I don’t have anything bad to say about those companies but after a while the same drinks get monotonous, pricy, and given that someone else is making the drink it’s hard to get the same quality every time. In 2016 I switched to a ninja coffee bar to make my own iced coffee at home but that got to be too cumbersome. (Yes, I realize it is almost asisine to think brewing coffee is hard; but when you wake up and have to rush for work on little sleep you want something that requires no effort). I tried a cold brew pitcher which was alright but still required a little work to get right. When our ninja broke my husband wanted a keurig again and I cannot do keurig coffee so I went back to buying coffee drinks out and grew tired of spending 3.89 on a drink that I wasn’t sure I’d be happy with. I finally decided to bite on the jot ads and so far I’m so happy. The first cup I made with water and added creamer and sugar. It was good! The last two times I’ve poured the tbsp right into 8 oz of cold oat milk and it is perfect! Smooth velvety flavor with notes of cocoa is what I taste. The best part is it doesn’t taste burnt/rubbery and I don’t have to worry about a barista putting way too much milk in my drink.",5

8970,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/22/2020,"This product is so convenient. Living in a small studio apartment means I don't really have space for fancy coffee machines and equipment (e.g. coffee filters). With Jot, I can access rich, dense coffee directly from the jar without the hassle of brewing, straining, or maintenance. I simply take the jar out, mix with water and milk, and I'm ready to go. I would recommend this to folks who are in similar situations or simply want to cut costs on their morning coffee run. Not only is this product sustainable (e.g. can reuse the items), but it's easy to use and pretty on the eyes. However, I would caution people to remember that because of the small size, this coffee is HEAVILY concentrated, which means the flavor(s) can be harsh if you're not used to regular black coffee. I'm rating this product 4 out of 5 stars because the taste is a bit strong (unpleasant), but the product overall is extraordinary.",4
8971,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/22/2020,"This coffee is hands down my favorite type of instant/concentrated coffee. It mixes really well with all type of liquids, hot and cold. You just need to be sure to mix it well with whatever drink you have it in. I prefer to put a tablespoon of Jot in almond milk, it mixes really well and the taste is a balanced latte. As a coffee snob, this will not replace my typical Chemex, espresso, etc, but it is awesome for a lazy day where I don’t want to take ten minutes out of my day or I want a good cup of coffee mid work day.

8982,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/21/2020,"So, I don't really enjoy coffee that's been traditionally roasted/brewed. I've always loved cold brew and espresso, I think mostly due to the clear, usually not very bitter flavor profile. I drink cold brew by itself but I tend to drink espresso mixed with oat milk/cream and some form of sugar. A little long-winded, sorry, but Jot gives me much of the same flavor profile as espresso but with less of a bitter after taste like some cold brews. The best part for me is that I think the flavor profile actually counteracts the weird after taste of stevia so oat/cashew/coconut milk, jot, and caramel-flavored sweet drops (stevia brand) have been my go-to drink. It's not the greatest with almond milk but a coconut milk mixture really worked with jot. I'm really happy to be cutting down on my coffee shop cost without sugar while not having to drink something I don't enjoy",5
8983,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/21/2020,The hardest part of using Jot is figuring out what you want to mix it with. There are so many possibilities and I haven't tried one that I didn't like. It tastes perfectly fine. I'd say it tastes more like coffee flavor than actual coffee if that makes sense. I won't drink it daily but it's nice to have as an option.,5
8984,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/21/2020,"It couldn’t be easier to make iced coffee or hot cup in the morning. Excellent taste, very smooth. And it came in stylishly packaged with a spoon and suggested ways to enjoy Jot in the summer. I’ve already recommended to friends. Love it!

I like either mixing it with water and ice and adding a splash of creamer or I mix it into my caramel latte flavored protein shake and it’s perfect! The bottle is nice and doesn’t take up as much space as the large iced coffee jugs I used to buy, which is so convenient.

My preferred way is one serving of Jot with half a cup of water and half a cup of oat milk. The taste is a bit lighter/more floral maybe (?) than my usual preferred coffee flavors, but it's nice to try something new.

However, I highly suggest you don't try it undiluted - my boyfriend had a terrible experience doing that!

I saw Jot’s Instagram post and decided I’m drinking coffee everyday anyway, so might as well try...

WOW. They mean it when they say it packs a punch. One simple tablespoon with water or milk mixed in gets me the caffeine feeling I’d expect from several cups of coffee or a few energy drinks, without all the terrible ingredients and excessive sugar.

I’m hooked now. ",5

A lot of time I have trouble finishing an iced coffee, but Jot tastes really smooth, so i have no problem finishing it. I usually combine it with oat milk and it tastes super good. It also has more caffeine than my normal cup of coffee, so it keeps me feeling awake without jittery. Highly recommend!",5
9006,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/18/2020,"FIrst of all, just wanted to say that the packaging and presentation was extremely well thought out but excessive in my opinion.

There is a lot of paper waste that could probably not have been included to reduce waste and impact on the environment, but other than that A+ for packaging.

Now onto the coffee itself. I love that they included the stainless steel TBSP, but I wouldn't want it to ship out every single time they send me a new order. Maybe there's a way to just ship out just the coffee product? (And perhaps take off a few dollars without the spoon)

So I personally tried out the Iced Americano Recipe and it tasted very smooth for the drink itself. Barely any bitterness but there was this very particular flavor I noticed and it was akin to soy sauce. Not sure if this is just my batch, but I can't say I'm particularly fond of this flavor. But besides that it is a very pleasant drinking experience. Smooth & Strong.

I would recommend this product as it saves a person a lot of time to make coffee so if you're in a rush for your coffee fix, this is a great product.",4

It's just so easy for anything and everything. I haven't gone to crazy with trying different types of coffee drinks but it's so so good in just a cold brew style with ice or as a latte/capuchin. Don't think this will ever replace a fresh brewed cup of coffee and it's aromatics but at the same time ever since I subscribed I haven't brewed any coffee at home, so maybe im wrong.

A little about myself. I drink about 2-3 cups of coffee a day and it's a very important part of my day. Love the smell and taste of it but couldnt tell you anything about beans from Nicaragua or whatever. Point is Coffee is I love coffee and Jot coffee is delicious. Give it a try you won't be sorry.",5

9041,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/17/2020,"Overall, I did enjoy Jot and the different style it brings to the coffee experience. I like how easy and convenient it is, while also being more ecofriendly. At the same time, those who prefer their drinks stronger (people like me 😉) can make their drinks perfect without any hassle by simply adding more of the ultra coffee. 

All that being said, while I have enjoyed the cups of coffee I've made so far with Jot, I do wish there was some variety in the types of coffees available for the actual bottle/coffee itself. 

For instance, I enjoy darker coffees with a more chocolatey and roastier flavor to them. What I taste in Jot currently are some fruit undertones, and the fruity and citrus types of coffees are my least favorite. I prefer stronger and smokier flavors. 

If Jot were available in different roasts, from different beans that bring different flavors to make their own different ""Jots"" I think I could be more on board with this concept of taking and drinking coffee. Until then I don't honestly think I could stick to this beyond my first couple of orders since I prefer coffees of a different flavor!",4

Sure, I could attempt to make my own cold brew at home, like I have many times before, but no matter how expensive the beans or how diligently I heat and measure the water, it’s always bitter and acidic. And you know what? That makes me bitter and acidic. No good. So then I started buying premade cold brew by the jug (stōk) which tasted delish but I was well aware that I was paying $6 for mostly water, and a bottle was only about 4 cups of coffee. And it took up SO much room in my fridge because it had to be refrigerated even before it was opened. Struggle. Then my mom sent me a bottle of jot as a surprise, and my struggles came to an end. It’s strong, it’s smooth, it doesn’t need to be refrigerated until you open it, it only take up as much room as a bottle of water, and I subscribed so now IT SHOWS UP ON MY DOOR STEP. 

I jot hooked. Now I always have fuel to make bad puns and complain about refrigerator space (or lack there of). 

Also the design and packaging is really nice, which I appreciate. Cute lil black bun.",5
9070,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/16/2020,really enjoy the sharpness of the flavor - closer to a soft espresso than cold brew imo which makes it great for lattes!,5

9080,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/15/2020,"I was at first hesitant about Jot because I am somewhat of a coffee snob, but after the first cup I was hooked. It’s a silky coffee concentrate that lends well with anything. From water to coconut milk to sparkling water Jot just makes the coffee experience better. Furthermore, it provides me with energy that normal coffee, from Starbucks or at home, just doesn’t do for me. I’ve been using jot for a week now and have already purchased more. It’s a must have, I’ve raved about it to everyone and can’t wait for my next shipment. ",5
9081,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/15/2020,"It’s amazing to me how simple it is. I describe it to people as “instead of making the coffee and adding stuff to it, you pour your stuff in and and just add the coffee”. Much more simple, time efficient, and delicious. I don’t even need to add sweetener, just a tbsp of the ultra coffee into a cup of milk over ice and its game on. I love how well it works too, I feel more awake then a normal cup of coffee for sure.

GREAT PRODUCT. High quality coffee you could taste (I used to work at a coffee place that roased their own beans inhouse, so I became a coffee snob), and no bitterness. Rich deep flavor notes. It has kind of ruined me for commercial coffee places like Starbucks, who used to use concentrate and you could ask for full strength cold brew, but not anymore.. it is premixed/watered down. Not to mention their preference for having a burnt coffeebean taste, which they have always had. No more $5 blah drinks from Starbucks for me! Thanks, Jot!",5

I came across JOT. Let me add that the shipping was super fast!
After my first initial taste of the coffee, which I poured over ice and almond milk, I was instantly impressed and HOOKED. I love lattes and JOT is perfect for it. I no longer feel the need to go waste $5 on lattes anymore! At first I ordered just one bottle but soon after trying it, I purchased the set of two! Thanks JOT, for changing my coffee life!",5

So far we've used it with regular water and in dark chocolate milk but I think it'll taste great with anything. We used to do cold brew in the fridge but it takes up so much space and i personally didn't like it that much, so Jot is a very welcome surprise.

9167,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/12/2020,"I was skeptical. I'm from New York so I like my coffee strong and to give me energy. I've tried Jot both hot and cold and in my honest opinion the best taste is when its iced. I personally wouldnt drink it hot daily because I just like the ritual of brewing my own, but if ever run out of my coffee grounds I definitley dont feel like I'm sacrificing a good cup of coffee by making a hot Jot. I mainly got this because I've been on the hunt for an easy but great tasting coffee while camping. To only have to boil water, not have to deal with coffee grounds at the bottom of my cup from a perculator and have it taste strong and wake me up?! Sold! Quality product, worth every penny. Will buy again.

I have been practicing social distancing to the max and have really missed my coffee. K-cups just don't cut it - even the ones sold by the name brand I have always loved. Enter Jot to the rescue!!! I read comments on how other people had prepared them to be similar to their beloved lattes they drank before many places were shut down for awhile. I followed the tips and have been enjoying this brand of coffee both hot and cold (sometimes 2x a day), using water and milk. I add a little vanilla syrup and caramel drizzle. Even when things open back up all the way and I am no longer social distancing, I am a fan of Jot for life. This is going to save me so much money and as a bonus, it is better for the environment. You've gotta try it!",5

I've been so tired lately and although I didn't purchase Jot as a solution, it's become one anyway. It's hitting a caffeine nerve that long ago became numb to my regular cup of hot coffee in the morning.

It’s super concentrated so a little bottle provides 14 cups of coffee which is very impressive. 

The taste is quite good. I have only drank it black so far. Definitely water it down though. I tasted it without added water just because I want to know just how concentrated it was and it was incredibly strong.",5

Every morning I make at least a double shot of espresso, but usually it's more like 4 shots of espresso. And now, during the summer months, all I want is iced coffee. Then along comes Jot - the most amazing coffee concentrate I've had to date! 

In the midst of wrestling one baby into a onesie, trying to keep the other baby away from the toddler *****, and inevitably slinging cheerios across the room to the actual toddler, I can now enjoy an instant moment of serenity as I drink my Jot coffee. I can make a full 24 oz coffee in a matter of seconds and gulp it down in the midst of the chaos. And trust me when I tell you - the time I spend drinking that coffee is truly my favorite time of the morning!

Get Jot - your chaos will thank you!",5
9263,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/08/2020,"I absolutely love this stuff. I make iced lattes with it and it’s totally replaced stopping to get a latte before work in the mornings for me. The flavor is so good I don’t even need sweetener. Seriously love it!

9265,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/08/2020,"On a whim (thanks to an Instagram ad), I bought a bottle of Jot. It arrived quickly in packaging that begged me to take a photo. I’ve made the cold brew lemonade recipe (delicious), an iced latte, and my take on Vietnamese yogurt coffee (milk and yogurt over ice with a spoon of Jot). All are an easy, delicious, STRONG pick-me-up. I’ve already sent Jot to both my sister and mom as a gift.

This bottle is also a perfect, small size to leave in the fridge at work, as the communal coffee machine is no longer allowed :( Can't wait to experiment with the cocktail recipes!",5

9275,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/07/2020,"Growing up, no one in my family drank coffee. So I recently started drinking coffee while working at the ski resort this winter. When ski resorts were shut down, including mine, I decided I needed to get my own coffee maker. But I literally knew nothing about how to make coffee. I did not like the idea of all of the hot plastic in coffee makers and the uncertainty regarding sourcing and processing of the coffee from tree to mug... so I went without coffee for the last few months until I ordered Jot. It is SO easy. I just heat up some filtered water in a cup in the microwave and plop in a teaspoon of Jot into the cup with a little organic Brazilian rainforest honey. And wallah. Completely organically sourced coffee. No plastic, no BS. Just coffee.

9276,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,07/07/2020,"Y’all gotta get on this Jot stuff, it blew my darn mind. Already planning my next order!
It’s easy to use, mixes with everything, can be customized for your liking (some days I used half a tablespoon, some days I used one and a half), is absolutely scrumptious on its own, is so delicious with my usual oat milk and even the jar is reusable. There’s nothing to dislike - I’m a Jot convert!

Its so smooth. Its so bitter in a good way. I don't even add sweetener to it. It doesn't need it! Its so good with just water or your favorite milk (mines oat milk.) 
I am so excited to try it in baking experiments. Tarimasu will be my first!
Thank you again so much.

Taste-wise, it's OK. I haven't tried it with hot water yet, only cold brew style. I may have to experiment more with how much to add. I'm not convinced it is superior to brewed coffee (I usually make my own pour-over) but for cold brew, it's so convenient. Would love to see flavored versions like a French Vanilla version of Jot.",4

This morning I added a tablespoon of Jot and had a nicely caffeinated and tasty mocha. I also locked the Jot spoon clean to try it on its own, and while taken straight it is a bit assertive, it is somewhat like a short, syrupy shot of espresso?

I've been trying to replicate the taste of Dunkin/Starbucks iced coffee as a way to save money and time since I'm working from home now due to the pandemic. I have bought the Starbucks Iced and cold-brew but it tasted like dirt even when mixed with water while following the instructions. Saw an ad for Jot on Facebook and immediately purchased two bottles since I drink a lot of coffee. I take mine with 8oz of milk to coffee and the taste is incredible.

That method is still my favorite buy Jot is a close second. I feel the price point could be lower. I appreciate the presentation: custom box for bottle and spoon, metal spoon but not necessary from my viewpoint. If those 2 things were modified or eliminated I feel the cost could be less. I am not sure I will buy more but I am very pleased that I tried it!",3

I find it hard to nail the perfect ratio in my french press (and it usually take a lot of grounds), an at-home cold brew takes about 24 hours to brew in the fridge. You can avoid ALL that with Jot. I’ve now tried iced latte, cold brew, and regular boiled water with a splash of milk. Excited to try even more recipes with this! It doesn’t give me the jitters or the coffee slump/crash after.

The packaging was great, and I love the spoon included but I’d suggest asking the manufacturer to make the spoon more heavy duty as its flimsy and can bend but that’sa small detail you can change when the company raises more money. The coffee itself while good is just not as strong as I was hoping for. I don’t get the “eyes wide open” effect after drinking it like I do on other cold brew concentrates.

That will really get me through the day. In comparison, I don't get the jolt that I desire from Jot, even though 1 tablespoon is purported to be 150 mg of caffeine.

The idea of pouring a spoonful of coffee into a glass is much more appealing. I had no qualms about using a coffee like this, as i used to work at a luxury hotel at a major theme park in Anaheim that served coffee like this. 

I ordered the single serve bottle, and instantly fell in love. The flavor, ease of use, and explosive caffeine content is exactly what I was looking for. I made cups of coffee for three friends since, and all three commented on how good it was, and were surprised when I did the “big reveal.”

I couldn’t get through the first cup of Jot coffee.
The primary flavor point was burnt coffee.
I have been brewing Starbucks coffee for decades.
Primarily Verona.
I experienced concentrated coffee syrup as a young man
maybe 45 years ago and was quite impressed.
I think the reduction process is being pushed too fast.
Jot drizzled on vanilla ice cream and stirred in..tastes great...
I believe the creamy sweetness hides the burnt flavor point.

Deeper and richer without being stronger. There are depths and nuances of flavor that I can't quite put my finger (or taste buds) on. More sipping is definitely needed!

With just milk as I said above, it tastes fantastic.

Maybe another variant which has a more subdued flavor in water might be the next move. Just my opinion though",5

When I saw Jot, I was suspicious. Honestly, it looked too good to be true and I was nervous of a nasty tasting burnt and bitter instant coffee flavor profile. BOY, WAS I WRONG! The flavor is rich and smooth. No bitterness. And it’s just as amazingly easy as it looks. Want an iced coffee at 5am? Cup. Ice. Water. Spoonful of Jot. Stir. Done. GET IT!",5

Almost gave 4 stars as it's just a notch pricey - would be easier to justify if the per serving cost was at least comparable to pods... That said will make it more of a special occasion thing than a twice-a-day thing.,5

I've been drinking it as iced coffee (1T jot, 1T simple syrup, 6oz water, 2oz half and half over ice) and its definitely better than any of the store bought bottled ices coffees. The convenience of the small bottle cant be overstated if you have limited fridge space. I have also tried Jot as a latte per the instructions on the bottle (8oz hot milk, frothed and 1T Jot) and that was very good as well, however the iced coffee for the summer is great, and couldn't be easier.",4

Wow this stuff is strong and therefore you can use even less than the provided TBS (thanks for that btw!). I have to use about third of a cup of the previous mentioned coffee concentrate and so it doesn’t last as long as it should…and I am constantly having to brave a specialty store to buy it.

This is almost a syrup consistency and it tastes so smooth and flavorful…not like burnt beans. I am really surprised, as I bought this on a whim…I wasn’t expecting much. I also use it for affogato …hot coffee over ice cream. OH my…perfect.

If you are on the fence, give it a try…the price is right for how long it lasts too. If you are on the fence give it a go…packaged extremely well also. Well done gents.",5

I am an iced coffee drinker and I have to use almost twice the recipe for one small mason jar of coffee with 6 large ice cubes and milk. Wish it were cheaper because this could be a favorite.

I add it to water (8-10 oz) and then top with a bit of unsweetened creamer. I thought for sure it would taste watered down, but it doesn't. The rich, almost smoky, coffee flavor comes through. My only complaint is that it's pretty expensive compared to other cold brew concentrates I've tried or made myself. And if I had one suggestion on packaging...I wish the images were on easily removable decals instead of being printed onto the bottle. These bottles would be great to reuse for lots of things, but since they're covered in writing, I just throw them in the recycle bin.",4

It takes a minute to figure out how strong it actually is. It’s so delicious so that I probably drank too much the first few days, and was up very very late.
My bad. 
However, I would strongly encourage the development of a decaf version if possible. 
I know that I would buy both, one for the morning cup(s) and the decaf for the afternoon.

9637,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,06/26/2020,"Jot isn't bad, in fact it's good. It does what it's supposed to do. The issues I have with it come from how expensive it is for what you get and depending on how you view it even that expense could be worth it. In my world I can make AeroPress coffee according to James Hoffman's fake espresso technique and get a result as good or better than this. I have to clean up afterwards of course and doing that 3 times a day more ends up eating a bit of time. Jot appealed strongly to me for that reason. Unfortunately I spent $40 for a week's worth of coffee (2 200ml bottles ) and that is easily 4x what I would normally pay or buying, griding and making my own. Obviously, if you are used to going to coffee shops then you may be able to justify that cost, but I can't really. I also question the inclusion of the spoon and the sheer amount of cardboard in the packaging. If the price could be lowered even $10 ( per 2 ) and packaging made more minimal and less expensive I could see making it a part of my lifestyle. No one wants or needs a big tbsp. Also maybe just a bigger bottle? I would be more likely to buy a 750ml adjusting for price. Anyway that's where I'm at with it. The coffee tastes good, it's interesting, I want to be a subscriber but it's really hard to justify that pricetag for me personally.",3

It is the perfect “instant coffee”. Tastes well enough, versatile, and strong. Different than cold brew in a manner that you can make hot drinks with it. It’s on par with a mid grade cafe (better than Starbucks but not as good as your local all star barista). I use it as a quick cup between meetings or on trips. Mostly, it’s serving as an espresso replacement during lockdown. I would love to see different roasts in the future. ",5

9669,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,06/25/2020,"I really like the concept and convenience. Doesn't get any easier. Packaging was well-designed and secured the bottle well, but uses a lot of cardboard.

Jot is a good option, but won't fully replace my daily coffee rituals: freshly ground coffee; rotating type of bean each week or two; brewing method based on the amount of free time each morning; grounds are composted. Since Jot wouldn't be the daily choice, I foresee pushing the shelf life to the limit. The cost is favorable compared to a daily drink from coffee shop, but it's more expensive than the cost of beans and home brew.

My preferred uses for Jot:
1. Americano or iced coffee when time is very short
-- flavor is good, but not as tasty as brewed black coffee

2. Home espresso-based drinks, especially during pandemic: 
-- cheaper than buying espresso machine
-- much better experience than paper cup from coffee shop drive thru
-- flavor is better with some milk
-- time can be spent frothing milk instead of brewing",3

Out of curiosity I had a sip to see what it would taste on it's own. Has a very bitter/sour taste, but the aftertaste was nice. I wouldn't drink this everyday, because it is a little pricey...but on those days when you need the extra productivity I will be reaching for this. ",5

So soft and smooth if that's such a thing for coffee. It isn't acidic like I was afraid of happening. Definitely a solid buy and will buy more again.

9711,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,06/24/2020,"I have been an avid cold brew drinker for the past decade. I first discovered it in NYC specialty coffee shops where you could pretty reliably get strong flavorful cold brew albeit at a premium. As the cold brew trend became popular the quantity has increased but quality has decreased. Most coffee shops water it down so much that it tastes and looks like a mediocre iced tea. I eventually discovered that some places would serve straight concentrate if you asked for it or a cold brew latte (concentrate + milk). This became my go to but I couldn’t always find it and it was also expensive. Since then I’ve mainly made my own at home but I’ve occasionally tried store bought concentrate, however none of it was strong enough or if it was it didn’t taste good. Enter Jot. I LOVE this coffee. Whatever y’all are doing to make the ultra concentrate is magical. Delicious and potent. The perfect cold brew. Thanks for an awesome product! I never post ads on my social media but prior to this survey I actually already posted about Jot on my FB & IG because it’s that good. Keep doing what you are doing!",5
9712,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,06/24/2020,"Only four uses in and I have made a latte, a regular cup of black coffee, and two different kinds of faux-Frappuccinos! All have been phenomenal!
",5
9713,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,06/24/2020,"I ordered a 2-pack of Jot to try out, as I am just descending into utmost laziness after working from home for several months. I also typically would be purchasing iced coffee and cold brew during this time of the year and wanted something that could mimic that vibe. Jot concentrate does a great job at replicating the intensity and flavor of my favorite cold brews (Partners in Brooklyn, for example) and I've been having some fun mixing up my drink menu, adding in homemade spiced simple syrup, mixing the concentrate with seltzer, etc. 

You'll have to like the base flavor of the coffee to enjoy it, but I think it's a good option for those who like an intense flavor. It doesn't taste weak or cheap at all, but is also much easier than brewing the perfect cup of coffee from a bag of $20 beans. 

Would rebuy.",4

But my usual DIY home iced coffee will remain a Puerto Rico instant mixed in a quart batch the day before and chilled in the refrigerator. ‘Nearly’ as good tasting (to me….) and less expensive per cup. However, I am very happy with Jot for a couple niche iced coffee uses I have, namely (a) travel/portable, (b) alternative offer to guests (and conversation maker), and (c) impromptu gap-filler if I forgot to make the iced coffee batch the night before and thus it’s still chilling.

The thing I like most about Jot is the convenience. Whether I am getting up late and don't have time to brew coffee, or I don't want to mess with cleaning the pot, Jot offers something different. I especially like the higher caffeine content, which sits in the sweet spot of not being too little or too much. It is also perfect for keeping at work, for that 3 pm postprandial tiredness.
The flavor is good and deep. It does taste slightly bitter, but in a good way. It balances out nicely with cream. 
The over-ice option is awesome, too. I haven't been able to achieve this with regular brew coffee.

It is insanely fast and easy too. When my husband isn’t around to make me a french press or pour over, this is my go to, and it is hard not to go for round two in the afternoon. I give it 4 stars because it is almost TOO easy to drink- i like my coffee dirty and rich (black americano drinker) and this is missing that bite. Also it is not rich enough to add 8 oz of water AND tons of ice so i have started chilling my glass and water in the freezer and that does the trick.

I was surprised by how much Jot tastes like an iced latte from a high-end coffee house. It is not bitter, and the recommended ratio of one spoonful with 1 cup of milk creates a pleasant flavor. I personally prefer my lattes slightly darker, so I have been doing 1.5 spoonfuls of Jot + about 1.25 cups of milk. It has been so good that I have not made coffee in a week, and I am about to place my next order.",5

9763,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,06/23/2020,I was skeptical of just how concentrated it was. But I can tell you that one tablespoon does indeed pack the punch of at least a double-espresso (my usual). And tastes great!,5

Luckily, I got this email giving me a place to type one in so here it is: This stuff tastes amazing. I was expecting it’s convenience to diminish the flavor, but it did NOT. Its one of the best cups of coffee I’ve had, and I LOVE how I don't need to take the time to brew it! Takes the same time as making a cup of tea. I’m really looking forward to experimenting with the other things you can try with it, like over ice cream or blended into a smoothie.

9785,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,06/23/2020,"I am definitely a coffee snob and I was blown away by Jot. The flavor is bold and smooth with great caffeine content. There is no bitterness, oiliness or smokiness. I was skeptical about not having a fresh brewed cup of coffee but Jot tastes better than most fresh brewed coffees I’ve had. Highly recommend!!",5
9786,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,06/23/2020,"I love the concept, the environmentally-conscious way they're creating something really convenient. The only thing I wish was that there was one available with a different flavor profile—something more French Roasty/chocolately/nutty and less fruity, but this is just my personal preference (also maybe basic?). Love everything else about it.

I like to experiment with flavors so will try with my pecan- chicory bitter, a chocolate and or butterscotch shot (I’m a wanna be Starbucks barista) But the “ base” of the good Jot will not be smothered but rather enhanced, And convenience is awesome, especially in the pre caffeine morning.",5
9793,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,06/23/2020,"Bought Jot on a whim and I love it. I use it to make homemade Frappuccinos. So good. 1 Tbsp (or 2) of Jot with vanilla almond creamer and plant based milk, add ice and a square of chocolate. Blend. So refreshing and easy. Jot is smooth. No acidity for me. I’ll purchase again!",5

9796,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,06/23/2020,So I was sooo excited to get this coffee. I got it and mixed it and true for me it was a little strong. My husband liked the one tablespoon to 8 oz ratio but I had to play with mine. I’m more of a 12 oz to one tablespoon girl. And if you put it over ice after the ice melts it’s even better. Best at home cold coffee I’ve ever had!,5
9797,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,06/23/2020,Jot is the perfect way to get ready for the day. I make an iced coffee in the morning before my first conference call and It keeps me going all morning. I love the serving spoon. I love the packaging.

With lockdown and all it became very hard to get a cup of good coffee. That's why I wanted to try Jot. But now I'm hooked; it's really easy to do, I just warm the milk and add a scoop. It's also better for the environment as there are no pods. Last but not least the coffee is delicious! Up there amongst the best of my favourite coffee houses.

The flavor mixes well into all the drink combinations I've tried so far. I'd love to see different kinds of blends, along with bigger bottle sizes.

9806,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,06/23/2020,"My wife is not a coffee snob like me so she usually adds some form of creamer into her coffee.

As the only coffee drinker in the house, brewing a pot of coffee takes a disproportionate amount of time and clean-up. I am new to Jot, and I haven't done a lot of experimentation. Basically I throw an ice cube in a mug, a splash of Jot, a splash of milk, then fill the rest with water: BOOM delicious iced coffee in seconds. And no clean-up besides a dirty mug.

Also the packaging and altogether look of this product and website is absolutely beautiful. I’m all about it.

9814,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,06/23/2020,This coffee is smooth and convenient. You can make it hot for your morning cup and over ice in the afternoon. It doesn't lose its integrity either way and the great part is the consistency of flavor. It makes life easier. I vote for that!,5

Attempting to make iced coffee with a Keurig is a lengthy, overnight process, and stopping at a restaurant every morning isn’t ideal either. From my first cup of Jot, I knew I’d be a life-long customer. I highly recommend this product to anyone who enjoys iced coffee, as this is THE solution for saving time and money. Came in a cute box with a tablespoon and carrying bag, and I have zero complaints (maybe besides getting me hooked for life!) Buy it now, you won’t regret it!!",5

I've really enjoyed having an iced latte every day for the last week. This is partially because Jot tastes good cold, but also partially because I don't like how it tastes as a hot drink. My first thought when tasting Jot in a hot latte was one of those Starbucks bottled Frappuccinos -- more coffee flavoring than actual coffee taste. After a few of these disappointing lattes, I finally tried it iced. What a difference! I actually enjoyed it!

One tablespoon and I can make a big glass with decent boldness. Or use extra and get a real slap in the face. The taste is really good and the coffee comes out super smooth. Love it for iced coffee and have not tried yet for hot, but assume it would work well with hot water too. Really happy with my purchase, and I will probably get more.

I have had my Jot for two weeks now and have used most of it - it is good! It is so convenient to just pour a cup of almond milk and mix in a TBSP to get a nice, cold coffee. Admittedly, I only use about 3/4 of the recommended TBSP because there is a slight bitterness to Jot. It isn't enough to ruin it for me, and at 3/4 the bitterness is basically gone.

9952,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,06/17/2020,"Great bottle to make infused coffee drinks. I don't really see this as a make a quick cold brew, batch brew, or espresso though. I prefer it as a concentrate for drinks. 

Here is a recipe I've been using a lot. 1 TBSP JOT coffee, 1 fl oz Dirty Drink Co Chai Spice Syrup, 6 ounces milk over ice. Delicious dirty chai latte.

Also if you like affogato mix 1 tbsp of JOT with 2 ounces of hot water and combine until its fully mixed. Let it thicken a bit then pour over a scoop(or two) of gelato or ice cream.",5

TBH I can’t account for the effectiveness of the caffeine, everyone else can do that. What I will testify LOUDLY about is the flavor. Before Jot, my favorite coffee was Cafe La Semeuse, and I would start drooling thinking about those beans.Now Jot has taken the top spot and is so much less work, and still drool inducing. I’m still making my iced lattes, and also made a batch of coffee ice cream that was also addicting,",5

Finally found Jot and it’s the most convenient option and it’s price comes right between what I was previously doing. Plus it’s small enough that I can bring it to my parent’s place when I stay over.

Oh and it tastes great! Super smooth with nothing but water.",5
9974,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,06/16/2020,"We're enjoying Jot. Our favorite is a super quick iced ""Americano"". A regular hot Americano is good, too, as long as you get the ratio right. It seems that if you add a bit too much water, it becomes pretty bitter. I love that it comes in an easily reusable or recyclable glass bottle. We'll be buying this again to have on hand.",5
9975,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,06/16/2020,"This coffee tastes great and couldn't be easier to make, but it is also extremely aesthetically pleasing. The packaging is super sleek and the bottle itself is reminiscent of a wine bottle-- it makes me feel unspeakably fancy (lol). We don't have a proper coffee machine and so I was happy to have this to serve to our house guests this week in particular. It's perhaps a little on the expensive side, but it's definitely cheaper than the $6 lattes I was buying at work every morning before the lockdown, especially because it's really strong and gives me a good caffeine buzz. Will probably keep drinking this more or less forever.",5

I’ve brewed with chemex, French press, pour overs, etc and have tried my own attempts at concentrated cold brew because there are many times when I want a cup of coffee but if I’m out of the house or traveling, it’s not convenient. And K-cups/Keurig is a mediocre cup of coffee at best. Jot is super convenient, travels well, and more importantly is bold, smooth, not overly acidic or burnt in flavor.. it tastes excellent.

While I simply drop a tablespoon in, I watch my co workers struggle with french presses, aeropresses, manual grinders, etc. It takes me literally 10 seconds to have the best cup of coffee in the world.

So far, it’s really good in milk, but it was a bit overwhelmingly milky. I was not a fan of an americano, as the coffee flavor got lost in 9oz of hot water. Today I made an espresso (in 3oz water), and then added milk, and that was a great combo. There are still so many ways to try, and I’m looking forward to doing that!",4

I’m still playing around with the coffee/water ratio, but found the 1 teaspoon to 8 ounces of water combo a little on the weak side for me. I do like my coffee with a punch.

Adding a teaspoon to 8 ounces of cold water made a very delicious iced coffee, however. 

I guess my real issue is with the cost. $28 is a lot and it doesn’t make a ton of coffee. Will I keep it around for convenience sake, maybe.",4

I am really enjoying it as cold-brew, where the cold oat-milk froth blends in nicely. However, when I have made it as hot coffee, the warm oat-milk froth curdles in the coffee - still tastes more or less okay but really is unpleasant looking in the cup and requires constant stirring to re-integrate the oat milk back into the coffee. I haven't had it over ice cream yet, but it seems the absolute perfect use for this dark gold.",3

By today's coffee standards the stuff I drank back then that was good enough to kick start my coffee habit was probably terrible, like gas station coffee terrible. I have grown and so has my coffee knowledge and taste. Honestly, I don't need another coffee thing or coffee suggestion or coffee anything. I'm kind of a coffee- geek; I have a built-in Miele espresso machine, a Moka Pot, a French Press, a Nespresso, etc. so you can see that I really didn't need to buy Jot, but I did (Thanks, IG you know me well). This ultra coffee is deliciously smooth and slightly sweet. For me, just the right amount of sweet so as to not be overpowering. So far I have only made a hot latte with oat milk and it has replaced my 2nd Americano of the morning. I have to admit I was shocked to find that a coffee concentrate could be smooth and not bitter. I cannot wait to experiment with iced coffee drinks this summer. If you love all things coffee, then this is absolutely worth trying.",5
10054,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,06/11/2020,It’s strong and convenient but a bit too acidic for my taste. I like a darker roast which tends to be more mellow. But I’d use it if I needed a caffeine fix in a rush.,3

I also don’t live near any shops that make a cold brew I like. Jot solved my issue! I can make the best cold brew drink in less than a minute. I also made a delicious coffee shake.

This is by far the best concentrated coffee I've ever had. I'm not a huge fan of cold brew and I haven't seen a lot of iced coffee type products I can make it home that I actually like. This is delicious. I can customize it to how exactly I like the strength. I've been making it with coconut milk in the morning and it's great.

10070,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,06/10/2020,"Would highly recommend Jot. My favorite quality about Jot is it’s ability to provide a consistent level of top tier quality every time. Jot is excellent for making custom coffee exactly how it is liked. Also Jot saves a whole lot of time compared to other methods. 

First time users be advised: 
To better judge the Jot quantity & make the coffee ‘how you like it’, would recommend giving Jot a taste before the first pour. So would say there is a bit of a learning curve (as with most things). Personally, after trying a little taste, made judgment for custom proportions (instead of 1 spoon to 8oz ratio). 

That being said, there were no ‘recipes’ by Jot other than the 1 spoon to 8oz ratio suggested; which didn’t think applied well to “everyone”. 

More guidance in the packaging or ‘recipes’ in the Jot website would possibly go a long way for those that tend to need that sort of guidance. Would suggest Jot provide some guidance/directions for first time users who may feel overwhelmed by the amount of caffeine in concentrated ultra-coffee. For example, filling the spoon less and adding a little refrigerated coffee creamer and milk made a big difference (if you like coffee that way). 

To be honest, this was originally a gift for my wife. Daily coffee is required and, in the pursuit for great coffee, we have tried almost every coffee method (french-press, Keurig, fresh ground coffee beans, turkish, etc.). Have to admit after the 1st cup we were both very impressed by Jot. Even has me craving a delicious drink or two. Would be happy to consider this a permanent item. Also fun to think of new ways to use Jot.",5

I might be weird, but I'm pretty sure I'm not alone in wishing that there was an extra/double strength version.

I took my Jot bottle and spoon to a weekend camping trip, and I was able to easily make 4 cups of coffee for us everyday we were out there! No coffee machine needed, just boiling water.

For an afternoon pick-me-up and snack, I’ll put a little JOT in cold chocolate milk for an iced mocha however, in chocolate milk JOT makes the drink taste a little salty though it could be the type of chocolate milk I use. Still delicious though. 

Because I normally drink red eyes, I find that I need a little more then a tablespoon. I need about a tablespoon and a dash extra. Gives a clean feeling energy - no jitters. I will be buying again!",5

Keep up the great work! The only quell I have is the flavor. The Jot tastes over roasted and bitter, like most roasts at Starbucks coffee; although Starbucks has among the best tasting black cold brew and nitro beverages (I never add sugar and rarely add milk). Your product idea is great and need a signature flavor that tastes, at the very least, really good. For people who just need caffeine it works; it’s easy. For people who love coffee for its flavor, along with the sophistication of the current coffee renaissance, Jot falls short. I am open for an in depth discussion if you are interested.

My usual go-to cups are triple americano or Greek iced coffee - espresso frappe. I was skeptical about Jot but it turned out to be surprisingly satisfying. It has the body and aroma as you expect from a freshly brewed coffee and gives you enough strength (not watered down at all). It makes a great cup of strong coffee and can be easily shaken into a delicious iced coffee. I even made it into espresso martinis and it didn’t disappoint either.

It has really great flavor that gives an amazing cold brew experience. I like the cold brew so much that I haven't even tried any other method yet. The packaging and presentation is also beautiful. I love the touch of including the metal scoop (a very 2012 Soylent move). 

I will absolutely continue to use Jot and promote it. Especially in a time where spending entire days at home, this is an essential product to me.",5

Typically at home I use a french press and pour it over ice and add half and half. I'm also really bad at making coffee with a french press, so it usually settles at the bottom and it's pretty bitter. Ok now to Jot. HOLY ****. Made my first ice coffee with it today. I usually hate using almond milk because it's too watery and I don't like sweetener in my coffee, but I was out of cream so I made an exception. I poured some almond milk over ice, added one scoop of Jot and then stirred in a little water until I had the right consistency. After my first sip, I actually said ""whoaaa"" out loud....to myself...and then immediately texted a friend who drinks a ton of coffee to demand that she try it. She was sold. I'm excited to play around with it, but mostly I'm thrilled at how quickly I can make a super delicious ice coffee without any work whatsoever. It's the closest thing to magic I've experienced since the start of quarantine!",5

I love it for that urgent first cup of the day or a mid-afternoon boost of black iced coffee. Always cold or iced!

It's absolutely delicious. Although I have a high tolerance for caffeine, I did worry a little bit about the claim it was 20x stronger than traditional coffee, I decided to try it with the full spoonful as recommended (figuring I could dial it down a bit if it was too much).

Smooth feel while drinking, Not acidic, Doesn’t taste “burnt”
Cons:
Has a weird after taste. Almost like that of an essence. It has mild aroma for the first 2-3 cups but fades away very veryyy quickly. I expected more punch for something touted to be this intense. 

TLDR: I think if you lose the almost-fake essence-y feel to it and added more aroma - you could find me to be a regular customer. But for now I’d pass at a second buy.",3

10342,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/29/2020,"I love the concept of this and purchased a bottle moments after I first saw it. It has almost everything it needs to be phenomenal. My only 2 complaints are the flavor and the price. The flavor, although good, is not something that knocks my socks off like I was hoping. I have tried many different ratios of water to jot and haven't found the right one yet I guess. I also feel like it is a few dollars more expensive than what you get for that price. 

I am a fan though, and will purchase more in the future. It won't replace my normal daily cup as it is right now, but it is nice to have around when I need a quick coffee fix, especially when I am craving iced coffee. However, if they work on the flavor a bit, or offer new and different flavors and possibly come down on the price a bit, I can see this replacing my normal cup of coffee as my main squeeze.",4

I like to grind my beans fresh, control my water temp, etc. I ordered on a wish and a prayer and have been so glad that I did! Simple and yummy! I've messed around with different amounts of water and cream, but the coffee is rich and bold without being bitter. I don't even need sugar for it to taste coffee house special, which is great for reducing calories and limiting my sugar addiction... Thrilled with the taste and the convenience. And although it's not necessarily critical, I really adore that they include the tablespoon measuring spoon. It's a one stop shop and my best quarentine purchase!",5

With Jot, I’ve been making it a glass at a time and I’m loving the whole ritual. The stopper in the glass bottle makes it feel like I’m opening a magic potion (isn’t that truly what coffee is?) and the silver tablespoon adds to the drama. I’ve found my perfect recipe after a couple days of experimenting: 8 oz unsweetened almond milk, 8 oz cold water, a splash of sugar free vanilla coffee syrup, ice and two tablespoons of Jot, all in a tall tumbler. I love watching the Jot swirl through the milk until it’s all the perfect shade. Love it.",5

From the website's design and UX, to the pervasiveness of their advertising, to the unboxing experience, the branding is beautiful and on-point. Further, the coffee is GREAT. I was prepared to be underwhelmed by the taste because 1) I am (or was) cynical about concentrated coffee and 2) the brand experience is SO top notch that I thought the product couldn't possibly live up to it. I'm thrilled to be completely wrong about that 😃 They've killed it with Jot. I'm fully on board.",5

10382,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/27/2020,"Very intense so requires a bit of fine-tuning when first making an iced coffee. Tip: Measure out cold water. If you pour water over ice without measuring, then add Jot, you can get the ratios wrong and end up with an overly-strong brew. Do try this as an iced latte with oatmilk (I prefer unsweetened). Astonishingly good.",5
10383,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/27/2020,I really love the full flavour of this coffee without it being too strong or bitter. It is so hard to find coffee that is full and balanced. I have been telling everyone about this!!,5

As a totally new coffee experience, we'd love to know what you thought."" Since I received the coffee late yesterday (I guess Jot thinks snail mail moves faster than it does), and since I don't drink caffeine after noon, I had to wait until today. The coffee is good, but frankly, I thought the taste would be richer, after I had read the advertising. So far, it does not taste better than my current coffee. Tomorrow I'll try less less water. Surprisingly, the pretty spoon that was included holds visibly more water than each of my two other tablespoon measuring spoons. Unimportant but annoying: the design of the bottle cap is very deceiving. While trying to remove the plastic covering, I accidentally opened the bottle. Least important and strangest: some of the white printing on the bottle had been smudge/wiped off as if the bottle had been handled a lot.",4

I’m in Puerto Rico and received the item in about a week from my order date. I love the measuring spoon included :) now onto the important stuff. I made a latte and the taste is really good.

And sometimes there's not enough time in the week to stock up on cold brew concentrate at the grocery store. But this bottle has been an incredible solution at the office for fast and easy caffeination. I love playing with the ratio of Jot to water, depending on how I'm feeling at the moment. The overall flavor is crisp and high quality. I especially appreciated the beautiful spoon included in my first shipment.",5
10391,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/27/2020,"Love how easy it is to now make a great cup of full-bodied coffee, hot or cold. Blows away the K-cups. I now have a K-cup coffee maker strictly for use to make hot water…haha!",5

It seems a little wasteful and of course these things all cost money. So I guess what I am also saying is that I don’t want to pay for all these things, beautiful as they are, each time I buy coffee.

10399,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/26/2020,Really enjoyed the coffee - the flavor is robust and complex as compared to other concentrates. The price for the quantity you get is a little out of balance.,4
10400,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/26/2020,Much easier than running out to a coffee shop in the afternoon when it's a hot day and your pourover or nespresso won't cut it.

10404,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/26/2020,"I am NOT a coffee and in all honesty I don't mind drinking instant coffee *gasp* as long as it gets the job done (getting me caffeinated so I can start my day). Obviously, I am not a morning person, but during the week I need to be up bright and early and at work before 6. I have been searching for something to help speed up my morning routine and this it. I really like the taste of this ultra coffee but more importantly, I love the ease of making it. Personally, I just mix with water and ice most days and on rare occasions i'll thrown in some stevia. Just the fact that it taste good without cream/milk or sweetened syrups is a plus in my book. Each tablespoon has a good amount of caffeine (about 140) so I don't use the full amount due to my caffeine sensitivity. My only con with this Ultra Coffee is that I wish it lasted longer than 30 days from the time you open it. I'm using less than half a tablespoon each time so it could last longer than the 30 days if the shelf life allowed for it. It'd be awesome if there was an option for a smaller sized bottle for example 100 ml bottles with only a week's worth of servings. As much as I like the taste and ease of this coffee, I'm not sure if this is a product I'd keep buying consistently in the future because of the price. At 24 dollars per bottle (14 servings) plus shipping cost it can get a bit expensive, especially to those having 1 or more servings per day. It is definitely nice to have on days when you're running late and need a quick pick me up without the acidic taste that many instant coffee's have just wish the shelf life was longer!",4

It has a bright flavor profile similar to the best of the third wave coffee shops (Joe, Blue Bottle, etc) without being entirely overwhelming. The best part is that a little goes a long way - with roughly one tablespoon I can make a great large glass of cold brew whereas with more typical concentrates I've tried I would need more like a 1/3 of a cup to get the same test. Highly recommend! I drink it black with water (though my wife tried it with her oat milk and loved it as well)",5

This stuff, however, is seriously good! Way better than I expected! It has a pure coffee flavor, with no weird overtones, underhangs, or offshoots.

Wrong terms, but you know what I mean—you drink some coffee and detect a faint flavor of...what? Anchovies? Over-ripe pears? And the aroma—was it more like lighter fluid? Shoe polish? 

THIS coffee, however, is the perfect representation, the pure essence of The Thing Itself. Plato's coffee. ",5

That being said, I wish larger bottles were available. My boyfriend and I went through the tiny bottle rather quickly (drinking 2 cups of coffee a day).

Honestly, we are coffee and tea aficionados (okay, we are snobs) and we were fully prepared to be underwhelmed. Your Insta advert was so slick, and the marketing was cute. So I figured why not try it out? Now we are truly fans! It's just so easy if we are in a hurry, or just want an affragotto.

10496,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/21/2020,"You can make roughly 40 cups of coffee from a pound of beans.

Make no mistake, Jot is good. Very tasty. I compared it to my regular cup of coffee that I make with an AeroPress and two scoops of good coffee this morning. It was fine. But definitely not $1.51 per cup better. Jot is excellent coffee for lazy people. It comes with a custom-imprinted spoon in very fancy (costly) packaging. It requires shipping.

Where I’m struggling a little is with getting the perfect mix. I find when mixed with 8oz of hot water it comes out tasting watered down. It tastes great shaken up with about 6 oz of milk and a little sugar over ice, but to make a 12oz iced coffee then equates to 280mg of caffeine, which is kinda high.

However, that was not the case at all. It mixed easily with low-fat milk, and actually tasted semi-sweet enough that I only needed to add 1/2 a teaspoon of sugar. It's as convenient as instant coffee, yet tastes far better and makes for an easy, affordable cold brew in warmer months.",5

I love iced coffee but don't usually have the time to make it at home.Jot over ice is a great alternative and it takes maybe 30 seconds to whip it together. I'll definitely be putting in a second order. 

My only criticism is that the coffee was pretty acidic, which some people in my household didn't like.",4

-for a company committed to a smaller carbon footprint, the packaging is super wasteful (even though the presentation is very nice)
-overall the coffee flavor is somewhat reminiscent of pre-packaged coffee—less bitter, but still reminds me a bit of a bottled Starbucks frappuccino",4

I never know how the brew is going to be that day - most of the time it is watered down and its inconvenient taking 20-30 minutes out of my morning to go & get coffee (I never make my own at home because of my lifestyle). Jot is the PERFECT remedy for me. I throw 1-2 tbps in my water bottle in the morning & I am out the door and caffeinated in >1 minute. The coffee tastes amazing & goes well with anything (I like to put it in my steel cut oatmeal). Rarely give reviews but this product deserves more than 5 stars.,5

First off, the packaging it arrives in is very nice, well thought out, and has a premium feel, right down to the included tablespoon dispenser, which is quite chic. A good omen. I've made some lattes and iced coffee so far, and I must admit, the quality of the coffee is very good. I love my coffee morning routine, so this isn't likely to replace that, but I will definitely be incorporating Jot regularly as my go-to cold coffee drinks. Jot makes it ridiculously easy to get a high quality cold brew style coffee.",5
10579,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/18/2020,"This coffee suffers from the same stale coffee flavor that all coffee not consumed a few hours after brewing develops, but does produce an acceptable, strong cup of coffee with the given recipes. 

Because I'd rather allocate my daily caffeine allowance elsewhere,I did some exploration with where else to use Jot. I've found that it makes a great coffee ice cream, and does an incredible job replacing instant espresso powder in chocolate flavored baking. Replace some of the liquid in your chocolate cake recipe with Jot and I have no doubt you'll love the result. 

As for replacing the coffee you drink, if you're a busy person with a packed fridge and coffee's taste is mostly a side interest to getting caffeinated, I'm sure you'll love it. Otherwise, probably not your cup of tea.",3

I am a coffee snob and the concept of ""ultra coffee"" felt like a gimmick. I only purchased it because I was tired of drinking the same coffee options and thought the Instagram ads were sexy. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised. My wife and I are hooked. Delicious iced lattes that are easy. We don't crash from the caffeine and really savor every moment of that cup.

Maybe I should have started with just 1 TEAspoon...it'd be nice if it came with a smaller size measuring spoon as well, for those of us who need a little less than 140mg of caffein.

Anyway, I really do like how it tastes. It's got chocolatey undertones that I don't mind. As someone who would give my life for iced oat milk lattes, I love that this is a liquid, not a powder, that I can splash into some oat milk and BOOM have a glass of cold, creamy oat latte bliss. 

Nitpick: the cap screws back on in a weird way – I'm never sure if it's fully on.

Overall, what would make this review a 5 and not a 4, would be more information up front that helps me manage caffein levels because ""just one tablespoon"" f*cked me up!",4

10619,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/16/2020,"I bought this the second I read about it and it was so worth it! I usually pay $5+ for a coffee in NYC, but a bottle of this equates to less than $1! It’s quick and easy to make, I love that it can be hot or iced, portable if I wanted to keep it at the office, shipped right to your door, and most importantly... DELICIOUS! Such a great concept and I’ve been telling everyone I talk to about it!",5
10620,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/16/2020,"My first taste of Jot was an iced americano with sugar free sweetener. I wasn’t all that thrilled, but decided to give it another shot. I bought some unsweetened oat milk, Madagascar vanilla extract and zero calorie sweetener drops. I hit the jackpot. This drink is INCREDIBLE. I hate how coffee tastes acidic and very bitter, but the Oat milk is creamy and basic so it completely cuts out the acidity for the smoothest cup of coffee on earth. Before every sip I think “there’s no way this is THAT good” and then the second the coffee hits my taste buds i realize “oh my god it IS this good!” I immediately bought three more bottles of Jot After only my second cup. I’m now a customer for life.

It’s so easy to make and I’m really surprised by the strength of the coffee when using just the recommended size. I have to be honest I ordered partly out of skepticism and wanting to see for myself but it really is a strong cup. I’ve been making excellent ice coffees and I feel like it will last me a while.

I'm liking the product so far. The coldbrew lacks a little bit of that natural sweetness I like. It tastes a bit like stok's brand coffee, which is to say generically bitter. Though, for this low price idk how much better you could make it ;) 

Also, I sent a separate email, but I thought the packaging was a bit excessive for the enviromental claims

10652,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/14/2020,"When one talks about ""Instant"" Coffee, those powdered brands or pod brands come to mind. They serve the purpose but don't always taste great. JOT on the other hand is the type of Instant Coffee that not only tastes great but is also equally, if not simpler to make. Drink it hot, cold, as a shake, as a latte, as espresso! You are only limited by your own imagination. No matter what it is you create, a jot of JOT takes the drink to a different level. Highly satisfied and will highly recommend.

When I compare this coffee to a coffee shop cold brew (what I normally drink, pre-covid), I feel like I get a bit more of a flavor from the brew compared to Jot.

Are you experimenting with additional flavors? More premium beans? Should I just use more concentrate?

Mind you, I have nothing to compare it to, since I never had more than a sip of coffee in my life. But I really love it! Jot is so smooth that – no joke – I take it black.

Besides the flavor, what I appreciate most is how clean and easy it is to make. No grounds, no filter, no coffee maker needed... I just pour boiling water over a tablespoon of Jot and that's it.

I also appreciate that it is organic and fair trade, which makes it worth the relatively high cost.

Absolutely would buy again, and even order as a gift for friends. (One friend is very excited about Jot's portability, and plans to use it for camping.)",5

So I ordered a bottle of this slick looking coffee at around 2AM (maybe if I slept more I wouldn’t need coffee...more research required)

Well, after trying Jot I imagine that my coffee retirement will be delayed indefinitely. 

Jot makes making GOOD coffee easier than ever, you’re literally a tablespoon away from Iced, Frozen, or simple hot coffee! It’s glorious!

I’ll be buying whatever they come out with next 5sure! 😂",5

The texture and taste is very different than the myriad of coffees I have made at home, It is so different to me, I'm a bit confused as to what coffee is supposed to taste like. If the cost were closer to what I usually spend for coffee, I would select 5 stars, but the current price prohibits this from everyday use. It is really good, and I'm glad I tried a bottle, but even at 1 cup/day it is $40/month.",4

Jot is painfully easy to make, me and my boyfriend can’t get enough. It for sure needs a little sugar but after that, it’s good on ice or in almond milk. I want to try it with tonic water 😳 definitely try it if you can though 💓",4

I'm not a fan of the bitter, strong brews sold by a large conglomerate coffee shop, and wondered whether the cold brew concentrates would be a better option. So far so good! I've had Jot in lattes, breves, and iced cappucinos and they were flavorful without the feared bitterness. Although pricier than those in the grocery stores, I appreciate the compact glass containers as opposed to plastic bottles.",5

Placing my first order was easy and took about 5 mins as the website was very user friendly and made ordering very simple. My order arrived within a week, even despite the pandemic causing mail to slow down in some areas. Not only does this concentrate offer a deliciously robust flavor. You get some notes of chocolate and a rich full-bodied nutty aroma that only comes from fresh coffee, and the best part is no acidic flavor! As far as versatility goes with this product, it’s up to your imagination.",5

As a matter of personal taste, I find it a bit on the sour side as straight black coffee so I’ve been enjoying it more often as a latte. It would be interesting to see different types of brews become available down the line. ",4
10730,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/12/2020,"I like that this is just coffee and water. However, it has that slight sour / acidic taste that you get when you drink cold coffee. I wish it had more of a smooth / cold brew taste but not bad overall.

So far, I've experimented mixing it with hot water/milk/chocolate milk, with different amount. It's fun and I'm happy with the results. 

Making coffee with JOT is super convenient. The package comes with a measurement spoon, I heat up my milk or hot water, and add a spoonful. I used to make coffee over stovetop, which takes a while and the coffee taste is not consistent. With JOT, I can make a consistently good coffee within 30 seconds.

But ANOTHER amazing fact is that earlier this year I endured months of chronic stomach troubles and had to give up my coffee obsession!

10832,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/06/2020,"I purchased the product last week and it arrived this week. After first taste, I did not enjoy it; it was highly acidic and overly fake tasting as compared to a standard pour over or cup of coffee. I have tried to dilute it, adjusting the suggested recipe and still can't stomach it.

I do not envision trying it anymore after several attempts with your recipes and continued dislike. The first thing I tried was the recipe for 8oz water + 1 spoonful. Then I tried with almond milk (iced), and then with steamed almond milk. I took the TDS score (in case you're wondering, it was 20.00 when not dissolved)",3

The craftsmanship that went into this was stunning. I also love how convenient it is to make coffee with this, especially ice coffee since you are not using any sort of heat here to brew. The only thing I wished was that the taste to be bolder/stronger. I know I can add more scoops of Jot but I know I will be adding more caffeine to my day than needed, but this is completely personal coffee preference and perhaps in the future, with growing business, the company will have more products with various different tasting coffees.",4

I usually make a latte with 3/4 cup of espresso and that was nowhere near as strong caffeine wise as 1 tablespoon of Jot. I notice an immediate difference when I have Jot, which is good or bad depending on if you're ready for that caffeine effect. Also when mixing it with almond milk, sometimes it splits so that's not ideal. But it tastes pretty good and is super convenient.",4

I tried another brand of coffee concentrate that was drinkable, at best. Jot tastes more like what you would get at a coffee house.

10854,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/05/2020,"It ended up tasting like a fairly poorly roasted coffee to me. I was expecting a much better tasting cup of coffee, something like a premium roaster or local coffee shop would brew; but it ended up being much more in line with the classic big brands. It's not like it's bad, it's just not very good. Honestly, it's most similar to a Starbucks type coffee in my opinion. It is super easy to make though.",3
10855,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/05/2020,"I'm not really a fan of cold coffee, but I've found that this tastes best chilled or over ice.

",5
10867,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/04/2020,"There's a vibrant quality to Jot Ultra Coffee that you don't get with brewing ground beans. I've always found the initial aroma and flavor associated with brewed coffee deteriorates during sipping or re-heating. But the Jot coffee flavor carries through with every cup.

Jot has a slight molasses flavor, with bite, instead of bitterness.
The way I like it is with whole milk (preferably unhomogenized, but never ultra-pasteurized). In a heated mug I put a tablespoon of Jot, pour hot water half way up, then fill to the top with hot milk. Often I whisk the milk while heating for a frothy cup.

Jot is such a convenient and efficient concentration. By heating water and/or milk I get strong coffee with flavor that lasts, whether slow sipping or re-heating. The smooth taste is there every time, from big mug to small shot, with minimal prep or fuss.",4

10872,jot.co,Jot,Ultra Coffee – Original,05/02/2020,"Packing, brand, concept; all great and well executed.

The roast profile is a bit off. Since you are dealing with such a concentrated form of coffee it’s going to trend harsh & bold. If I were you all I would do a Ethiopia, Guatemala, and maybe Kenya blend and roast quite a bit lighter.
