Hi,
I was hoping to speak with you about an ultra-luxury community focused magazine in Greenwich called Greenwich Lifestyle . I am a resident of this town and I truly love the community and all that it has to offer. I am looking to find potential partners that would be a great fit for our magazine and I would like to schedule some time to discuss potential opportunities. Greenwich Lifestyle Magazine is direct-mailed to affluent, high-income homes in Greenwich. In addition to receiving high visibility through our magazine, we offer digital and networking  capabilities. 



It would be great to include you as a partner. Please let me know if we can schedule some time to meet or schedule a call. If possible, how is Monday, 8/9, at 2pm or 230pm or Thursday, 8/11, at 10:30am or 11am?



Thank you for your time. I look forward to hearing from you!",312783

" Uh-O.  Hey,there,Did I just sign up for some sorta a lifetime program type of thing? I accidentally watched your ad a few hours ago. I'd never heard of these things before. I read some reviews and got...overly emotional.  Most likely over some entirely different issue.  I find that I get this way, you know, occasionally, and from time to time.  It's this sorta weepy-eyed-for-no-reason kinda feeling  that seems to creep up out from someplace deep, you know, down inside and immediately proceeds to beat-to-Hell the rational(-ish) bits of my body.  Ohhh, hey, wait just a gosh-darn minute here and, uh-huh, yes, I guess I know just precisely what all this gosh-darn crying and impulse buying thing is all about after all. I guess I musta just sorta forgot all about that gosh-darned bloody punctuation mark.
I'm all, you know, apologies and stuff, ladies, but I cannot possibly, you know, control what kinda contracts and stuff that the big red bully, you know, signs with that dot at the bottom of a question mark.  Frickin' period politics...end-times and all.
Speaking of... say, any chance I can cancel that membership, please and thanks, and I am so very,you know, very, very much obliged?
I'm not asking that you pull the plug entirely.
Surely, aint bein' surly nor demanding a refund nor nothin' like that.
I'd still, you know, very much like to try your product.
And I want you to keep my money for the one box.
Just kindly rip up the contract for me.
Now to set this email afire and write the real serious business-like version.
Hmmmn,..where did I set that 'e-kerosin'?

Hi Amber,

I?m Zori, your designated FLEXpert!

Things you should know about me:

1. There's nothing I love more than parmesan cheese.
2. I got my first period when I was 11. I thought I was prepared for it until it actually happened?I think I cried for about 2 whole hours; the hormones combined with the idea I'd have to deal with blood coming out of an area that was extremely confusing to me at the time for basically the rest of my life freaked me out. Can you tell I was a dramatic kid?
3. I have a really heavy flow and pretty gnarly cramps. Most months it feels like my vagina/uterus betrayed me, but I power through it because I'm a badass and so are you.
4. My first crush ever was Bill Nye the Science Guy. (Still going strong btw... it's weird, I know, stop judging me please.)

Things I'd love to know about you

1. What's your go-to tv show or podcast?
2. What's your sign?
3. Do you know whether or not Bill Nye is single?

My First Time Trying FLEX

It was pretty easy, I was scared, but quickly realized that my biggest issue was that I was overthinking it. Once I relaxed and tried it a couple time, I got it to stay in the right spot. Now, I use my FLEX discs on my lighter days, and my Flex Cup on the heavier ones.

Using discs and the cup has completely changed my definition of what TMI means; I used to be very shy, and self-conscious about my body/period. But now, I will literally have a conversation about my vagina just as casually as I'd talk about my foot or arm. I've never felt more empowered to be myself.

Let me know if you have any questions about using your disc; I've heard it all! Or if you just want to say hello, that's okay too! If you're not comfortable with reaching out to me, we have tons of helpful articles available in our FAQ. Here's a handy link (https://trk.klclick2.com/ls/click?upn=rrhvyJmnIAFv7avyRI6elE2ehM-2BcdQCawdQ6SpkT1YYGiHJ1DFPgIFDnYTFArAyRIXxJ60u0ABY9rAiqZLdsE5rkEXa3lfTwedIRUgK3Y-2Bhfx7wUWmZixYG4kzjfrKjwepraMwuOxL46So7qdE4nGLBwzHMfZFBgpuJ2O8Hc6S0yhGE2WruAz7AFHR8oRjM9ha7sDUpeyFcqRtmmldGgRiJsBxVTs3gCZJMCkCmWInRqOa6cdJeNnqbrJ5QInV6dXwSWUj3pxPqkObaCs5jQxmMisqKaVjBclkgH5KclEeSoIyQzhu6cKFJrq0myWnA4sLpxhkIYKAuAutnP2MUIvu-2B0ThIoj7n2Q9yP6x4BGCn-2Bbx4rVoMkwez2kUQTVaSbT0KuXDAzP9vxDv1-2B15MdOv6eU60gj54BIX6H32RlheeoAI9-2Fxa4K-2BpH5iInZB5sSmTCZSlMzv2HqKiDz8z37xkXF1ERKQhBJaEXQShRntfY-3DWL8f_p0NNoAy-2BSdXVAT2Sf4zk6cWgAkBFSkCvEaVIkqARMhkG7ka5uzHgX5pSFpgt-2BWmODQWY5-2FUtXcvuub8bD-2F1I614qVMgbJFO6oJjDrON2V-2B0-2FMHSBGpSMyBb1wzRt2-2FmLdwn8o1fEXm4qIOikyPf6zlKBuEQXZEh-2FLzEKAPig2uxw38M5noNxBA6iAs5TdxKBNUl8NfC4t7UBeZQiNs-2Bbb8dDGFID6bFyy1PZuPrGFe7xI4Ln3IKCkO4Gy2gJ-2FH8w-2FEYBjQFaS6jzagqu2ZnkqGaTawThLZpoRq6FzLp-2F13SUKzVlRYspBFlOfrcgQIOKqEyeMPJtyUT79xBGglRtbxP15y-2B6NdBsoO-2BgxiQR2vK5UrPmjMAfPEGBDExfrDFVPDb4GyxETuCZI5HzNUG1vg-3D-3D) if you're looking for more information about insertion and removal.

"1 My preferences differ with my mood. I enjoy everything from shows like friends and that 70s show all the way to documentaries, so quite a wide variety. 
2 I assume you mean zodiac sign? In that case, I?m an Aries and every description describes me pretty accurately because overall I have a pretty intense personality. 
3 I do not have the current relationship status of Bill Nye, and Siri said she doesn?t know him personally either. 


I actually do have questions about the FLEX disc. Most importantly is how is it inserted. I have watched the ads and videos so I know it sits in the widest part of your vagina but how do you know if it?s inserted correctly? Also, how/when is the recommended removal? 

Thank you!

"1- The Mindy Project.... I cut it on when I don?t know what to watch. Light, East, and so funny. 

2- Virgo!

3- I won?t judge you. Jim Carey was my first crush. 

I can?t wait to try the flex out. I got an IUD a year and a half ago. Everyone said I wouldn?t have a period after a few months but I spot 4-5 days a week. Not ideal since I started dating a guy in January. Just embarrassing to have a tampon in so much and for sex to end in surprise blood. Luckily he?s been super cool about it but it is uncomfortable to me. Hopefully this solves my unpredictable period problems.

My First Time Trying FLEX

It was pretty easy, I was scared, but quickly realized that my biggest issue was that I was overthinking it. Once I relaxed and tried it a couple time, I got it to stay in the right spot. Now, I use my FLEX discs on my lighter days, and my Flex Cup on the heavier ones.

Using discs and the cup has completely changed my definition of what TMI means; I used to be very shy, and self-conscious about my body/period. But now, I will literally have a conversation about my vagina just as casually as I'd talk about my foot or arm. I've never felt more empowered to be myself. 

Let me know if you have any questions about using your disc; I've heard it all! Or if you just want to say hello, that's okay too!

  1.  There's nothing I love more than parmesan cheese.
  2.  I got my first period when I was 11. I thought I was prepared for it until it actually happened?I think I cried for about 2 whole hours; the hormones combined with the idea I'd have to deal with blood coming out of an area that was extremely confusing to me at the time for basically the rest of my life freaked me out. Can you tell I was a dramatic kid?
  3.  I have a really heavy flow and pretty gnarly cramps. Most months it feels like my vagina/uterus betrayed me, but I power through it because I'm a badass and so are you.
  4.  My first crush ever was Bill Nye the Science Guy. (Still going strong btw... it's weird, I know, stop judging me please.)

Things I'd love to know about you

  1.  What's your go-to tv show or podcast?
  2.  What's your sign?
  3.  Do you know whether or not Bill Nye is single?

My First Time Trying FLEX

It was pretty easy, I was scared, but quickly realized that my biggest issue was that I was overthinking it. Once I relaxed and tried it a couple time, I got it to stay in the right spot. Now, I use my FLEX discs on my lighter days, and my Flex Cup on the heavier ones.

Using discs and the cup has completely changed my definition of what TMI means; I used to be very shy, and self-conscious about my body/period. But now, I will literally have a conversation about my vagina just as casually as I'd talk about my foot or arm. I've never felt more empowered to be myself.

Let me know if you have any questions about using your disc; I've heard it all! Or if you just want to say hello, that's okay too! If you're not comfortable with reaching out to me, we have tons of helpful articles available in our FAQ.

7. I?ve been using tampons for years and i have tried the discs before but they would leak for me. 
 
I am mostly just experiencing a lot of discomfort and pain when inserting and removing. I believe this is due to it probably being too big but I am unsure.

Hi there!

Thank you so much for being one of the first to try Keela and helping with our development process. We?re finishing up our testing reports for the cup, and I was wondering if you could try removing the cup with the pull string and like a traditional cup. Afterwards, can you answer the following questions:

1. Did you test the A or B size cup? 

2. Were you able to successfully remove the cup using the pull string? (Yes / No) 

3. Were you able to successfully remove the cup the traditional way, by pinching the sides of the cup? (Yes / No) 

4. Is there anything about your experience you would like to let us know about?

2. It only catches a small amount of blood in the cup just most is leaking out. 
3. Yes the cup is comfortable. 
4. The cup feels like it?s in the right place. The flex tip isn?t hanging out. I insert it in and then kind of let it naturally go where it wants. After I?m checking to make sure it?s open everywhere and it feels like it is, but maybe I just can?t feel the difference I?m not sure.

"1. Any of the medical drama shows - especially into The Good Doctor right now. 
2. I always thought it was like the peanut butter (Jif) but I think I'm wrong...
3. Good question! My son (3yo) recently discovered Bill Nye on Amazon prime and he's obsessed!!

Question: I ordered the Flex discs for an upcoming vacation to Cabo ?? I haven't had a period since my daughter was born (1.5yo) but I feel like my hormones are shifting (and I'm planning to wean my daughter while we're gone) and I just *know* it will come on vacation. How easy are the discs to figure out the first time? Like, is there a learning curve? Should I pack some backup (pads? Tampons?) I also have a menstrual cup, but I haven't ever used that either! Help! ?? I'm probably overthink this too, but I just really want this vacation to be relaxing - and hopefully romantic too!

Thanks,
Stacey

So here's the issue that I'm having with my flex. I have a very high tilted cervix. My finger is not long enough to remove it or place it in the right place. I use one of my smaller glass dildos to make sure it's in the right place { had to use what was on hand lol) but the removal is extremely difficult!!! Do you have any suggestions?

I would love to see you all put out some type of removal tool that would help people like me hook it and be able to remove it with some type of tool instead of even our fingers. 

Anxiously awaiting any suggestions,
Bethany

Things You Should Know About Me

1. There's nothing I love more than parmesan cheese.
2. I got my first period when I was 11. I thought I was prepared for it until it actually happened?I think I cried for about 2 whole hours; the hormones combined with the idea I'd have to deal with blood coming out of an area that was extremely confusing to me at the time for basically the rest of my life freaked me out. Can you tell I was a dramatic kid? 
3. I have a really heavy flow and pretty gnarly cramps. Most months it feels like my vagina/uterus betrayed me, but I power through it because I'm a badass and so are you.
4. My first crush ever was Bill Nye the Science Guy. (Still going strong btw... it's weird, I know, stop judging me please.)

Things I'd love to know about you:

1. What's your go-to tv show or podcast?
2. What's your sign?
3. Do you know whether or not Bill Nye is single?

My First Time Trying FLEX

It was pretty easy, I was scared, but quickly realized that my biggest issue was that I was overthinking it. Once I relaxed and tried it a couple time, I got it to stay in the right spot. Now, I use my FLEX discs on my lighter days, and my Flex Cup on the heavier ones.

Using discs and the cup has completely changed my definition of what TMI means; I used to be very shy, and self-conscious about my body/period. But now, I will literally have a conversation about my vagina just as casually as I'd talk about my foot or arm. I've never felt more empowered to be myself. 

Let me know if you have any questions about using your disc; I've heard it all! Or if you just want to say hello, that's okay too!

3. Do you know whether or not Bill Nye is single?

My First Time Trying FLEX

It was pretty easy, I was scared, but quickly realized that my biggest issue was that I was overthinking it. Once I relaxed and tried it a couple time, I got it to stay in the right spot. Now, I use my FLEX discs on my lighter days, and my Flex Cup on the heavier ones.

Using discs and the cup has completely changed my definition of what TMI means; I used to be very shy, and self-conscious about my body/period. But now, I will literally have a conversation about my vagina just as casually as I'd talk about my foot or arm. I've never felt more empowered to be myself.

Let me know if you have any questions about using your disc; I've heard it all! Or if you just want to say hello, that's okay too! If you're not comfortable with reaching out to me, we have tons of helpful articles available in our FAQ.

Looking forward to being the 1st of my friends to try this. So I can get everyone on the bandwagon.  I'm the opposite of you, my periods are so light. I cramp,  and am not happy about it, but I don't feel like I'm dying. However,  I can empathize with my sisters with heavier periods. I hate mine, I can't imagine how bad yours are!!!

I am actually a little concerned because I can tell Flex was designed for heavy periods. There is almost nothing on the market for light. I was looking forward to a reusable cup because save the environment but it looks like they aren't suggested for light periods. Regardless. I'm super excited. And more than a little nervous about getting the placement right. Just like everyone else. :)

Hi Brandie,

I?m Zori, your designated FLEXpert!

Things you should know about me:

  1.  There's nothing I love more than parmesan cheese.
  2.  I got my first period when I was 11. I thought I was prepared for it until it actually happened?I think I cried for about 2 whole hours; the hormones combined with the idea I'd have to deal with blood coming out of an area that was extremely confusing to me at the time for basically the rest of my life freaked me out. Can you tell I was a dramatic kid?
  3.  I have a really heavy flow and pretty gnarly cramps. Most months it feels like my vagina/uterus betrayed me, but I power through it because I'm a badass and so are you.
  4.  My first crush ever was Bill Nye the Science Guy. (Still going strong btw... it's weird, I know, stop judging me please.)

Things I'd love to know about you

  1.  What's your go-to tv show or podcast?
  2.  What's your sign?
  3.  Do you know whether or not Bill Nye is single?

My First Time Trying FLEX

It was pretty easy, I was scared, but quickly realized that my biggest issue was that I was overthinking it. Once I relaxed and tried it a couple time, I got it to stay in the right spot. Now, I use my FLEX discs on my lighter days, and my Flex Cup on the heavier ones.

Using discs and the cup has completely changed my definition of what TMI means; I used to be very shy, and self-conscious about my body/period. But now, I will literally have a conversation about my vagina just as casually as I'd talk about my foot or arm. I've never felt more empowered to be myself.

Let me know if you have any questions about using your disc; I've heard it all! Or if you just want to say hello, that's okay too! If you're not comfortable with reaching out to me, we have tons of helpful articles available in our FAQ.

Hi Tara,

I?m Zori, your designated Flexpert!

Things You Should Know About Me

1. There's nothing I love more than parmesan cheese.
2. I got my first period when I was 11. I thought I was prepared for it until it actually happened?I think I cried for about 2 whole hours; the hormones combined with the idea I'd have to deal with blood coming out of an area that was extremely confusing to me at the time for basically the rest of my life freaked me out. Can you tell I was a dramatic kid? 
3. I have a really heavy flow and pretty gnarly cramps. Most months it feels like my vagina/uterus betrayed me, but I power through it because I'm a badass and so are you.
4. My first crush ever was Bill Nye the Science Guy. (Still going strong btw... it's weird, I know, stop judging me please.)

Things I'd love to know about you:

1. What's your go-to tv show or podcast?
2. What's your sign?
3. Do you know whether or not Bill Nye is single?

My First Time Trying FLEX

It was pretty easy, I was scared, but quickly realized that my biggest issue was that I was overthinking it. Once I relaxed and tried it a couple time, I got it to stay in the right spot. Now, I use my FLEX discs on my lighter days, and my Flex Cup on the heavier ones.

Using discs and the cup has completely changed my definition of what TMI means; I used to be very shy, and self-conscious about my body/period. But now, I will literally have a conversation about my vagina just as casually as I'd talk about my foot or arm. I've never felt more empowered to be myself. 

Let me know if you have any questions about using your disc; I've heard it all! Or if you just want to say hello, that's okay too!

"1. Go to tv show : anything binge worthy on Netflix. Currently watching Queen of the South and Orange is the new black
2. I?m a Scorpio 
3. Idk about Bill Nye?s relationship status ?? 

I do have a few questions about my flex though. So is it normal for it to leak when I sit down to use the restroom? I don?t have a super heavy flow but I noticed that it kept leaking when I?d sit down to go to the bathroom. It felt like it was in the right place, idk. And also does it matter which way it goes in? I tried both ways (up and down is the only way I know how to describe the position of the clear plastic and the black rim) but it still leaked.

Hello,

So first time using the disks. Yesterday was my day 1 & I didn't feel nervous or anything about using the disk. Put it in, felt fine. No leaks.But I notices that today, on day 2, there is more slippage. I go to the bathroom & check it, & its like today I can't get it to stay. I was swimming & felt some leakage. Never while standing or while I was actually in the pool, it was while sitting down. I went straight to the bathroom & checked the disk. It had slipped & therefore leakage. So I'm writing to ask what I could be doing wrong? I insert until I feel the first end start to go down, then push the other end past the pelvic bone. The reading i have done said that if sitting it can slip, but once u stand it will go back in place. If I sit a lot for work, or just in the day, will this be a continuing issue?

Mostly I'm just worried about sex with one in. My boyfriend is very large and so I wondered the risks, or I guess the chances of it going up too far and getting stuck. And how I would deal with such an instance.

I tried a generic menstrual cup a while back and was not pleased. I used it while sleeping first bc my pads tend to move when I sleep and don't catch everything. (Wearing tampons makes my cramps so much worse so I stopped using them a few years ago). Anyway, it caught NONE of the blood. I woke up soaked and the cup was empty when I took it out. It was also super uncomfortable. Hoping to have a better experience with these. I'm super light for 3/4 days then have for 2/3 and light again for a day or two. I had my tubes removed last year so my period is lighter but longer now.ÿ

My First Time Trying FLEX

It was pretty easy, I was scared, but quickly realized that my biggest issue was that I was overthinking it. Once I relaxed and tried it a couple time, I got it to stay in the right spot. Now, I use my FLEX discs on my lighter days, and my Flex Cup on the heavier ones.

Using discs and the cup has completely changed my definition of what TMI means; I used to be very shy, and self-conscious about my body/period. But now, I will literally have a conversation about my vagina just as casually as I'd talk about my foot or arm. I've never felt more empowered to be myself.ÿ

Let me know if you have any questions about using your disc; I've heard it all! Or if you just want to say hello, that's okay too!

"1. Hello zori  I wanted to say hi this will be my first time trying flex and I'm pretty excited to try it and have an alternative to using pads or tampons. I'd have to say my go to tv show currently is probly Lucifer on Netflix. Not sure what you mean by what my sign is but I'm going to guess you mean astrological though I have several in my birth chart aries is my sun sign. As for bill Nye being single I have no clue but he's definitely a good pick. I did have a question though. I'm wondering how I pause start and stop my subscription. I have a feeling I'm going to like flex but don't want my card charged for my next subscription due to not being sure when the funds will be available so I would like to know how to do this so I can other do ot now or before my card is charged so I can make sure it is able to go through. Any help on how to go about this is apricheated.

"1. I don't watch a lot of TV or listen to podcasts, but if I feel vegetative I can usually go for a true crime or nature documentary.
2. I'm a Cancer.
3. Upon some research I found that Bill Nye is single and that his ex-wife is pretty much crazy and tried to ruin him, so be gentle, okay?

I have used cups before but have had a lot of trouble getting them to ""sit"" right so that I don't leak. If I can get it right then it's a wonderland, but more often than not I would end up with leaks. I got tired of dealing and went back to a tampon/pad combo. I was excited about the 12 hour promise, especially because that's ideal for travel, but leaking is a deal breaker.

So, is there much difference in inserting this vs a cup? Is there a reason you don't use the disc on your heavy days? Should I still double up with a pad?

Hi Katie,

I?m Zori, your designated FLEXpert!

Things you should know about me:

  1.  There's nothing I love more than parmesan cheese.
  2.  I got my first period when I was 11. I thought I was prepared for it until it actually happened?I think I cried for about 2 whole hours; the hormones combined with the idea I'd have to deal with blood coming out of an area that was extremely confusing to me at the time for basically the rest of my life freaked me out. Can you tell I was a dramatic kid?
  3.  I have a really heavy flow and pretty gnarly cramps. Most months it feels like my vagina/uterus betrayed me, but I power through it because I'm a badass and so are you.
  4.  My first crush ever was Bill Nye the Science Guy. (Still going strong btw... it's weird, I know, stop judging me please.)

Things I'd love to know about you

  1.  What's your go-to tv show or podcast?
  2.  What's your sign?
  3.  Do you know whether or not Bill Nye is single?

My First Time Trying FLEX

It was pretty easy, I was scared, but quickly realized that my biggest issue was that I was overthinking it. Once I relaxed and tried it a couple time, I got it to stay in the right spot. Now, I use my FLEX discs on my lighter days, and my Flex Cup on the heavier ones.

Using discs and the cup has completely changed my definition of what TMI means; I used to be very shy, and self-conscious about my body/period. But now, I will literally have a conversation about my vagina just as casually as I'd talk about my foot or arm. I've never felt more empowered to be myself.

Let me know if you have any questions about using your disc; I've heard it all! Or if you just want to say hello, that's okay too! If you're not comfortable with reaching out to me, we have tons of helpful articles available in our FAQ.

3. As far as I know, he is single =D

I'm excited to try this! My boyfriend is concerned about the having sex with it in part. Will he feel it? Is it really possible to have sex without any mess??  I'm really hoping it lessens the cramps. And oh the money that will be saved on tampons! Not to mention the trash!

Thanks for the hello and reaching out!

[I'd love to know more about you]

3. Absolutely no clue.

So I am needing something other than a tampon. I have heard a lot about flex, but I have no idea how to insert or remove. I?m going on a cruise, graduating high school and getting married within the next couple of months and I needed an alternative to tampons/pads. I?m open for any advice.

My First Time Trying FLEX

It was pretty easy, I was scared, but quickly realized that my biggest issue was that I was overthinking it. Once I relaxed and tried it a couple time, I got it to stay in the right spot. Now, I use my FLEX discs on my lighter days, and my Flex Cup on the heavier ones.

Using discs and the cup has completely changed my definition of what TMI means; I used to be very shy, and self-conscious about my body/period. But now, I will literally have a conversation about my vagina just as casually as I'd talk about my foot or or arm. I've never felt more empowered to be myself. 

Let me know if you have any questions about using your disc; I've heard it all! Or if you just want to say hello, that's okay too!

Thanks for breaking the ice! Ecen as sn adult, i hate talking about the P word! LOL I got my first period when i was 10. My daughter got hers at 11. She was better prepared than I. 

I am anxious to try this produxt. My period lasts about 4 days. Im assuming i will be using two Flex gadgets per day. Not sure what the kits contain. It seems.like it may be  bit messy to remove. Is that the case? How does it work during sex?

My First Time Trying FLEX

It was pretty easy, I was scared, but quickly realized that my biggest issue was that I was overthinking it. Once I relaxed and tried it a couple time, I got it to stay in the right spot. Now, I use my FLEX discs on my lighter days, and my Flex Cup on the heavier ones.

Using discs and the cup has completely changed my definition of what TMI means; I used to be very shy, and self-conscious about my body/period. But now, I will literally have a conversation about my vagina just as casually as I'd talk about my foot or arm. I've never felt more empowered to be myself.

Hi Kaitlyn,

I?m Zori, your designated Flexpert!

Things You Should Know About Me

  1.  There's nothing I love more than parmesan cheese.
  2.  I got my first period when I was 11. I thought I was prepared for it until it actually happened?I think I cried for about 2 whole hours; the hormones combined with the idea I'd have to deal with blood coming out of an area that was extremely confusing to me at the time for basically the rest of my life freaked me out. Can you tell I was a dramatic kid?
  3.  I have a really heavy flow and pretty gnarly cramps. Most months it feels like my vagina/uterus betrayed me, but I power through it because I'm a badass and so are you.
  4.  My first crush ever was Bill Nye the Science Guy. (Still going strong btw... it's weird, I know, stop judging me please.)

Things I'd love to know about you:

  1.  What's your go-to tv show or podcast?
  2.  What's your sign?
  3.  Do you know whether or not Bill Nye is single?

My First Time Trying FLEX

It was pretty easy, I was scared, but quickly realized that my biggest issue was that I was overthinking it. Once I relaxed and tried it a couple time, I got it to stay in the right spot. Now, I use my FLEX discs on my lighter days, and my Flex Cup on the heavier ones.

Using discs and the cup has completely changed my definition of what TMI means; I used to be very shy, and self-conscious about my body/period. But now, I will literally have a conversation about my vagina just as casually as I'd talk about my foot or arm. I've never felt more empowered to be myself.

Let me know if you have any questions about using your disc; I've heard it all! Or if you just want to say hello, that's okay too!

Hi Jennifer,

I?m Zori, your designated FLEXpert!

Things you should know about me:

1. There's nothing I love more than parmesan cheese.
2. I got my first period when I was 11. I thought I was prepared for it until it actually happened?I think I cried for about 2 whole hours; the hormones combined with the idea I'd have to deal with blood coming out of an area that was extremely confusing to me at the time for basically the rest of my life freaked me out. Can you tell I was a dramatic kid?
3. I have a really heavy flow and pretty gnarly cramps. Most months it feels like my vagina/uterus betrayed me, but I power through it because I'm a badass and so are you.
4. My first crush ever was Bill Nye the Science Guy. (Still going strong btw... it's weird, I know, stop judging me please.)

Things I'd love to know about you

1. What's your go-to tv show or podcast?
2. What's your sign?
3. Do you know whether or not Bill Nye is single?

My First Time Trying FLEX

It was pretty easy, I was scared, but quickly realized that my biggest issue was that I was overthinking it. Once I relaxed and tried it a couple time, I got it to stay in the right spot. Now, I use my FLEX discs on my lighter days, and my Flex Cup on the heavier ones.

Using discs and the cup has completely changed my definition of what TMI means; I used to be very shy, and self-conscious about my body/period. But now, I will literally have a conversation about my vagina just as casually as I'd talk about my foot or arm. I've never felt more empowered to be myself.

My First Time Trying FLEX

It was pretty easy, I was scared, but quickly realized that my biggest issue was that I was overthinking it. Once I relaxed and tried it a couple time, I got it to stay in the right spot. Now, I use my FLEX discs on my lighter days, and my Flex Cup on the heavier ones.

Using discs and the cup has completely changed my definition of what TMI means; I used to be very shy, and self-conscious about my body/period. But now, I will literally have a conversation about my vagina just as casually as I'd talk about my foot orÿarm. I've never felt more empowered to be myself.ÿ

Let me know if you have any questions about using your disc; I've heard it all! Or if you just want to say hello, that's okay too! If you're not comfortable with reaching out to me, we have tons of helpful articles available in ourÿFAQ. Here's a handy link if you're looking forÿmore information about insertion and removal. I hope you end up lovin' your discs!ÿ

"1. Love your cheese obsession. 
2. I got my period at a young age too. 
3. Nerdy guys are the best. My ex did meet him and said he had a bit of an ego. But that's probably bc it wasn't you. Once he meets you, he will fall hard for you. :) Ask him if he is single over Twitter. Lol

"1.  My cramps can range from just simple twitches to completely bent over in pain. Will this reduce the pain of my most serious cramps?

2. I also have a weird cycle, where i could be heavy for 3 days for one month or very light for 5 days for another month. should i go with medium just to be on the safe side of things?

3. Also, I have never had sex (and i dont know if that would make a difference), so would they fit me weird or be uncomfortable?

Thank you!

4. I just got confirmation of an order. What plan am I on? How would I go about cancelling if I decided I no longer wanted flex?  MY account is either under sarah@sarahtry.com or sarahbtry@gmail.com 

Thanks

I thought I was prepared for it until it actually happened?I think I cried for about 2 whole hours; the hormones combined with the idea I'd have to deal with blood coming out of an area that was extremely confusing to me at the time for basically the rest of my life freaked me out. Can you tell I was a dramatic kid?

Things You Should Know About Me

1. There's nothing I love more than parmesan cheese.
2. I got my first period when I was 11. I thought I was prepared for it until it actually happened?I think I cried for about 2 whole hours; the hormones combined with the idea I'd have to deal with blood coming out of an area that was extremely confusing to me at the time for basically the rest of my life freaked me out. Can you tell I was a dramatic kid? 
3. I have a really heavy flow and pretty gnarly cramps. Most months it feels like my vagina/uterus betrayed me, but I power through it because I'm a badass and so are you.
4. My first crush ever was Bill Nye the Science Guy. (Still going strong btw... it's weird, I know, stop judging me please.)

Things I'd love to know about you:

1. What's your go-to tv show or podcast?
2. What's your sign?
3. Do you know whether or not Bill Nye is single?

My First Time Trying FLEX

It was pretty easy, I was scared, but quickly realized that my biggest issue was that I was overthinking it. Once I relaxed and tried it a couple time, I got it to stay in the right spot. Now, I use my FLEX discs on my lighter days, and my Flex Cup on the heavier ones.

Using discs and the cup has completely changed my definition of what TMI means; I used to be very shy, and self-conscious about my body/period. But now, I will literally have a conversation about my vagina just as casually as I'd talk about my foot or arm. I've never felt more empowered to be myself. 

Let me know if you have any questions about using your disc; I've heard it all! Or if you just want to say hello, that's okay too!

Hi Katelynn,

I?m Zori, your designated Flexpert!

Things You Should Know About Me

1. There's nothing I love more than parmesan cheese.
2. I got my first period when I was 11. I thought I was prepared for it until it actually happened?I think I cried for about 2 whole hours; the hormones combined with the idea I'd have to deal with blood coming out of an area that was extremely confusing to me at the time for basically the rest of my life freaked me out. Can you tell I was a dramatic kid? 
3. I have a really heavy flow and pretty gnarly cramps. Most months it feels like my vagina/uterus betrayed me, but I power through it because I'm a badass and so are you.
4. My first crush ever was Bill Nye the Science Guy. (Still going strong btw... it's weird, I know, stop judging me please.)

Things I'd love to know about you:

1. What's your go-to tv show or podcast?
2. What's your sign?
3. Do you know whether or not Bill Nye is single?

My First Time Trying FLEX

It was pretty easy, I was scared, but quickly realized that my biggest issue was that I was overthinking it. Once I relaxed and tried it a couple time, I got it to stay in the right spot. Now, I use my FLEX discs on my lighter days, and my Flex Cup on the heavier ones.

Using discs and the cup has completely changed my definition of what TMI means; I used to be very shy, and self-conscious about my body/period. But now, I will literally have a conversation about my vagina just as casually as I'd talk about my foot or arm. I've never felt more empowered to be myself. 

Let me know if you have any questions about using your disc; I've heard it all! Or if you just want to say hello, that's okay too!

3.  Not sure but I think he?s married

Got my first period at age 9, heavy and awful.  Used birth control specially to avoid my period, it worked until about 2 years ago and it?s back to being awful.   Good to know about the cup, I?m kinda old school but the discs so far have been good, except for 1 really heavy day but it still lasted longer than a tampon

Thanks for the email, even if it was automated. It's almost 2 am and I'm bored out of my mind after spending 12+ hours on IG on my one and only off day bc I'm an overworked and almost brain dead healthcare worker. 

Just when I started to feel envious of those stuck at home with their SO's and endless bottles of wine and snacks, I saw a tragic news story about a doctor in NY who committed suicide after treating hundreds of Covid patients and I remember what's really important. And I don't want to become so wrapped up in the sadness of the state our world is in at the moment that I forget to be human. So I wanted to take a sec and answer your questions and say thank you.  

And if I get this thing stuck up in there a la Carrie Bradshaw, I'm glad to know I have my own Samantha to talk me down and fix it.

Hi Stacey,

I?m Zori, your designated FLEXpert!

Things you should know about me:

  1.  There's nothing I love more than parmesan cheese.
  2.  I got my first period when I was 11. I thought I was prepared for it until it actually happened?I think I cried for about 2 whole hours; the hormones combined with the idea I'd have to deal with blood coming out of an area that was extremely confusing to me at the time for basically the rest of my life freaked me out. Can you tell I was a dramatic kid?
  3.  I have a really heavy flow and pretty gnarly cramps. Most months it feels like my vagina/uterus betrayed me, but I power through it because I'm a badass and so are you.
  4.  My first crush ever was Bill Nye the Science Guy. (Still going strong btw... it's weird, I know, stop judging me please.)

Things I'd love to know about you

  1.  What's your go-to tv show or podcast?
  2.  What's your sign?
  3.  Do you know whether or not Bill Nye is single?

My First Time Trying FLEX

It was pretty easy, I was scared, but quickly realized that my biggest issue was that I was overthinking it. Once I relaxed and tried it a couple time, I got it to stay in the right spot. Now, I use my FLEX discs on my lighter days, and my Flex Cup on the heavier ones.

Using discs and the cup has completely changed my definition of what TMI means; I used to be very shy, and self-conscious about my body/period. But now, I will literally have a conversation about my vagina just as casually as I'd talk about my foot or arm. I've never felt more empowered to be myself.

Let me know if you have any questions about using your disc; I've heard it all! Or if you just want to say hello, that's okay too! If you're not comfortable with reaching out to me, we have tons of helpful articles available in our FAQ.

I cannot wait to try flex.  Hoping it is as good as I have read.  My main concern on my period has been horrible cramps, how long it lasts which also goes into my last one, not having sex on my period for over a week.  It?s not fair so I am truly hoping this helps.

3. I have to clue if Bill Nye is single or not.

But it's nice to meet you. I'm pretty shy myself but can be very dramatic also. I choose to try this product out because my period is pretty normal at times, but I get random painful cramps. That makes me feel like I just caught the flu or something. So I'm just hoping Flex helps lessen my cramps since doctors haven't been much help.

My First Time Trying FLEX

It was pretty easy, I was scared, but quickly realized that my biggest issue was that I was overthinking it. Once I relaxed and tried it a couple time, I got it to stay in the right spot. Now, I use my FLEX discs on my lighter days, and my Flex Cup on the heavier ones.

Using discs and the cup has completely changed my definition of what TMI means; I used to be very shy, and self-conscious about my body/period. But now, I will literally have a conversation about my vagina just as casually as I'd talk about my foot or arm. I've never felt more empowered to be myself.

Let me know if you have any questions about using your disc; I've heard it all! Or if you just want to say hello, that's okay too! If you're not comfortable with reaching out to me, we have tons of helpful articles available in our FAQ.

Hello I?m La Rissa . I?m 29 and I?m a Medical Assistant/ Phlebotmist / everything else the doctors don?t like to do such as xrays, Ivs, etc . Not ever been too shy about my body; I have been using the diva cup and I can say I do like it most days but there is some discomfort and pain in getting it in and placed right I have a smaller canal than most, and have problems getting the cup in place and to open up. Hoping the disc will be easier and more fitting . Can?t wait to try it out. I have light periods and only bleed 4 days as I use the Nuva ring for bc.  Thanks for the info

Things You Should Know About Me

1. There's nothing I love more than parmesan cheese.
2. I got my first period when I was 11. I thought I was prepared for it until it actually happened?I think I cried for about 2 whole hours; the hormones combined with the idea I'd have to deal with blood coming out of an area that was extremely confusing to me at the time for basically the rest of my life freaked me out. Can you tell I was a dramatic kid? 
3. I have a really heavy flow and pretty gnarly cramps. Most months it feels like my vagina/uterus betrayed me, but I power through it because I'm a badass and so are you.
4. My first crush ever was Bill Nye the Science Guy. (Still going strong btw... it's weird, I know, stop judging me please.)

My First Time Trying FLEX

It was pretty easy, I was scared, but quickly realized that my biggest issue was that I was overthinking it. Once I relaxed and tried it a couple time, I got it to stay in the right spot. Now, I use my FLEX discs on my lighter days, and my Flex Cup on the heavier ones.

Using discs and the cup has completely changed my definition of what TMI means; I used to be very shy, and self-conscious about my body/period. But now, I will literally have a conversation about my vagina just as casually as I'd talk about my foot or arm. I've never felt more empowered to be myself. 

Let me know if you have any questions about using your disc; I've heard it all! Or if you just want to say hello, that's okay too!

It was pretty easy, I was scared, but quickly realized that my biggest issue was that I was overthinking it. Once I relaxed and tried it a couple time, I got it to stay in the right spot. Now, I use my FLEX discs on my lighter days, and my Flex Cup on the heavier ones.

Using discs and the cup has completely changed my definition of what TMI means; I used to be very shy, and self-conscious about my body/period. But now, I will literally have a conversation about my vagina just as casually as I'd talk about my foot or arm. I've never felt more empowered to be myself. 

Let me know if you have any questions about using your disc; I've heard it all! Or if you just want to say hello, that's okay too!

"1. What's your go-to tv show or podcast?

I love watching TV and listening to audiobooks. As far as podcasts, I like to follow my brother who hosts a few with PsychCentral. His newest one is titled ?Not Crazy? which was predicated by A Bipolar a Schizophrenic and a Podcast.

1. What's your sign?

Born on June 28th, I?m a Cancer.

1. Do you know whether or not Bill Nye is single?  

I don?t know. Google states he?s divorced, but I don?t know if he is dating. My childhood crush was Jonathan Taylor Thomas, but now it?s Ryan Reynolds.

 

I?ve tried the diva cup before it was just so uncomfortable no matter which size I used and it hurt when I removed it. I threw it away. I?m willing to try this one because we go on a cruise in December and as luck would have it, I?ll be menstruating the entire time. I really don?t want to deal with tampons or pads while going to the activities and lounging on the beach.

Here?s praying it works!

Hi Debra,

I?m Zori, your designated Flexpert!

Things you should know about me

1. There's nothing I love more than parmesan cheese.

2. I got my first period when I was 11. I thought I was prepared for it until it actually happened?I think I cried for about 2 whole hours; the hormones combined with the idea I'd have to deal with blood coming out of an area that was extremely confusing to me at the time for basically the rest of my life freaked me out. Can you tell I was a dramatic kid? 

3. I have a really heavy flow and pretty gnarly cramps. Most months it feels like my vagina/uterus betrayed me, but I power through it because I'm a badass and so are you.

4. My first crush ever was Bill Nye the Science Guy. (Still going strong btw... it's weird, I know, stop judging me please.)

Things I'd love to know about you:

1. What's your go-to tv show or podcast?

2. What's your sign?

3. Do you know whether or not Bill Nye is single?

I may have some questions when I receive the product, I?ve never tried anything besides pads/tampons before.

"1.  What's your go-to tv show or podcast?

My fiance Ian has a podcast called ?mind rise with ian filo? and its reached six countries! Otherwise i love brooklyn 99, the office, jane the virgin, and America?s next top model.

  1.  What's your sign?

The sign of..... the kitten
Jk! I think I?m a capricorn, but I resonate more with the enneagram.

  1.  Do you know whether or not Bill Nye is single?

He?s totally married, boo. Sorry.

I?m getting flex because I?ll be married in a week and I?m concerned about period sex. Ian and I have talked through what that means, and he?s not too concerned about blood (neither am I) but I think there may still be some insecurity on both ends.

I?ve used a cup and it was a learning cup for a few months, but the stem kept curving up into my vagina and eventually created a sore! Who knew! Hoping for the best with flex.

By God?s grace;

My First Time Trying FLEX

It was pretty easy, I was scared, but quickly realized that my biggest issue was that I was overthinking it. Once I relaxed and tried it a couple time, I got it to stay in the right spot. Now, I use my FLEX discs on my lighter days, and my Flex Cup on the heavier ones.

Using discs and the cup has completely changed my definition of what TMI means; I used to be very shy, and self-conscious about my body/period. But now, I will literally have a conversation about my vagina just as casually as I'd talk about my foot or arm. I've never felt more empowered to be myself.

"1. What's your go-to tv show or podcast? O dont own a TV so all of my video viewing happens online. I predominantlt watch astrology videos. Chris Brennan's astrology podcast is a go to for me. And when im feeling a bit like trash TV, I watch housewives of ATL online.
2. What's your sign? Aries sun, scorpio moon and Aquarius rising
3. Do you know whether or not Bill is single? Are you kidding me? A hot and smart guy like Bill could never be single. 

So, I  have a question for you. I like to guess peoples sun signs. Are you a gemini, Leo or Aquarius? If none then what is your sun (and moon and rising) sign?

Hi Barbara,

I?m Zori, your designated FLEXpert!

Things you should know about me:

1. There's nothing I love more than parmesan cheese.
2. I got my first period when I was 11. I thought I was prepared for it until it actually happened?I think I cried for about 2 whole hours; the hormones combined with the idea I'd have to deal with blood coming out of an area that was extremely confusing to me at the time for basically the rest of my life freaked me out.

My First Time Trying FLEX

It was pretty easy, I was scared, but quickly realized that my biggest issue was that I was overthinking it. Once I relaxed and tried it a couple time, I got it to stay in the right spot. Now, I use my FLEX discs on my lighter days, and my Flex Cup on the heavier ones.

Using discs and the cup has completely changed my definition of what TMI means; I used to be very shy, and self-conscious about my body/period. But now, I will literally have a conversation about my vagina just as casually as I'd talk about my foot or arm. I've never felt more empowered to be myself.

Today is the first time trying flex...  First day of period. I have always had a super heavy flow on 2nd and 3rd day of my periods gradually growing from light to heavy and then slowing down usually on 4th day...  My cramps have brought tears to my eyes for usually the first 3 days and I do power through most of the time...  I have only been able to comfortably wear pads since I can remember...  So this is really different for me and kind of nervous about it. I haven't had any leaks yet. But it feels as if it is leaking I don't have a pad on just in case.  I bought this product thinking it would feel more comfortable and help with my cramps.  I will say that maybe once I get use to it, it could be more comfortable, which I figured when I ordered flex.  Right now I haven't had any less cramping and was wondering if it was in right even though it is not leaking?

Hi amanda,

Things You Should Know About Me

1. There's nothing I love more than parmesan cheese.
2. I got my first period when I was 11. I thought I was prepared for it until it actually happened?I think I cried for about 2 whole hours; the hormones combined with the idea I'd have to deal with blood coming out of an area that was extremely confusing to me at the time for basically the rest of my life freaked me out. Can you tell I was a dramatic kid? 
3. I have a really heavy flow and pretty gnarly cramps. Most months it feels like my vagina/uterus betrayed me, but I power through it because I'm a badass and so are you.
4. My first crush ever was Bill Nye the Science Guy. (Still going strong btw... it's weird, I know, stop judging me please.)

My First Time Trying FLEX

It was pretty easy, I was scared, but quickly realized that my biggest issue was that I was overthinking it. Once I relaxed and tried it a couple time, I got it to stay in the right spot. Now, I use my FLEX discs on my lighter days, and my Flex Cup on the heavier ones.

Using discs and the cup has completely changed my definition of what TMI means; I used to be very shy, and self-conscious about my body/period. But now, I will literally have a conversation about my vagina just as casually as I'd talk about my foot or or arm. I've never felt more empowered to be myself. 

Let me know if you have any questions about using your disc; I've heard it all! Or if you just want to say hello, that's okay too!

"1. When is your cup leaking?

After an hour of wearing

1. How much does it leak? 

Enough that I need to wear panty liner

1. Once inserted, is your cup comfortable during wear?

Yes

1. How high is your cup inserted?

Enough for me to grab to pull tab

1. Is this your first menstrual cup? If it is not, please let me know what brand/size you have used in the past 

I have used cups before.  I have the diva cup 2, and another one is the smaller one with a circle pull loop.  
The diva cup is hard to remove, especially if cup gets pushed up high, but it doesn?t leak.  

Thanks,
Melissa",307935
"1. When you inserted your cup, did the cup open fully?- yes, once the cup is inserted it opens fully. 
2. Once inserted, is your cup comfortable to wear?  Yes, super comfortable, can?t even tell it?s in there! 
3. When are you leaking?

* In the bathroom?
* All the time? Most of the time, and when I use the restroom
* After a few hours of wear?


I have not given birth vaginally, I have had my tubes removed which I read can cause heavy periods but I would say I have a normal to slightly heavy period. In the months I have used flex I have never filled the cup more than half-usually less than half.

"1.  Yes it did open up fully, I made sure multiple times, it?s definitely suctioning as I can tell when I?m pulling it out after wearing for even just a few minutes. 
2. Cup is very comfortable
3. It seams to be that I am leaking all of the time. I wore a panty liner under and had to change that every time I went to the bathroom.

Hi Candyce,

I?m Zori, your designated FLEXpert!

Things you should know about me:

  1.  There's nothing I love more than parmesan cheese.
  2.  I got my first period when I was 11. I thought I was prepared for it until it actually happened?I think I cried for about 2 whole hours; the hormones combined with the idea I'd have to deal with blood coming out of an area that was extremely confusing to me at the time for basically the rest of my life freaked me out. Can you tell I was a dramatic kid?
  3.  I have a really heavy flow and pretty gnarly cramps. Most months it feels like my vagina/uterus betrayed me, but I power through it because I'm a badass and so are you.
  4.  My first crush ever was Bill Nye the Science Guy. (Still going strong btw... it's weird, I know, stop judging me please.)

Things I'd love to know about you

  1.  What's your go-to tv show or podcast?
  2.  What's your sign?
  3.  Do you know whether or not Bill Nye is single?

My First Time Trying FLEX

It was pretty easy, I was scared, but quickly realized that my biggest issue was that I was overthinking it. Once I relaxed and tried it a couple time, I got it to stay in the right spot. Now, I use my FLEX discs on my lighter days, and my Flex Cup on the heavier ones.

Using discs and the cup has completely changed my definition of what TMI means; I used to be very shy, and self-conscious about my body/period. But now, I will literally have a conversation about my vagina just as casually as I'd talk about my foot or arm. I've never felt more empowered to be myself.

Let me know if you have any questions about using your disc; I've heard it all! Or if you just want to say hello, that's okay too! If you're not comfortable with reaching out to me, we have tons of helpful articles available in our FAQ.

"1) can I wear flex if I am having penetrative sex with a condom? Will there be an increase in friction (causing the condom to rip or break)? 
2) if I have sex while wearing flex does it need to be ?raw sex?? Also will flex protect against pregnancy if I don?t wear a condom
3)if I wear flex while having sex can my partner tear through it upon penetration? Will the blood pour out?",94471
"1) how am I sure it is in correctly? I can not feel it really (just placed it about 30 min ago). But I'm not sure I did it right.

2) I can very easily feel it when I put my finger in. My question is, how is sex comfortable with that? How is it not pushed further back? I ask this because I am a very short person with short fingers and if I can easily feel it I'm not sure how my husband wouldn't ""hit"" it.

Thanks so much!

"1) I don't really have a favorite TV show, but I am currently binge watching through all of my childhood favorites on Disney +
2) Sagittarius (But I am more proud of being a Hufflepuff)
3) According to google he was divorced in 2006 and is currently still single. Lol!

Don't actually know if you (or anyone) will see this, but we are trying to start this Monday off with a good attitude!

*I find it frustrating that there is only an option to pause or change quantity, and cancellation is not an easy option for us (might feel like good marketing, but doesn't feel good on this end)
*I tried calling to cancel, and understand it is likely a small company without phone representatives.  Still, I never heard back on my request to cancel.  That was mid july.  I just had more sent to me.
*I tried the product, but still prefer my diva cup.  I will continue experimenting with them on 'special occasions', but I have MORE THAN enough to do that with.

"1)  I'm head towards anything crime-show related (anything you can find on The Justice Network) or anything you'd find on TLC... Unless I run over to my series, then it's a whole different ball game- we're talkin Prison Break, The Walking Dead, Grey's Anatomy (although, I don't really like it since Derek left & they got rid of all of the other great people for the most part- I still love Meridith & Arizona, tho) & last, but not least, Supernatural!!

2)  Pisces ALLLL the way, baby!!! ?

3)  And honey, it Bill Nye ?? still alive? ?? I don't wanna break your heart & I hope I didn't freak you out, but I don't know anything about him lol. ?? I didn't even know he was still alive (if he is). ??

Sooo, I didn't know there were different things (cup & disc)... Do I have the discs? I may need cups if I do cuz I bleed like a stuck pig. I just started having my periods again since I stopped bleeding after having my last baby (who's over 2 now, but I bleed from before delivery until she was like 4-6 mos old- I can't remember for sure cuz I've bleed ALOT & for long periods of time following all 6 of my full-term baby's births & even some of my miscarriages). I tend to fill a ""heavy, extra-long, overnight with wings"" pad in about an hour. My cramps have always been horrible! I've got endometriosis & other health conditions that cause constant pain & issues, but WOW! OMG, since my periods have returned (I think I've had 3 now, maybe 4), they are horrendous!! I have my babies naturally & my labors were hell... These periods remind me of labor pains, which is normal, but only beginning labor pains. Mine feel like much harder labor pains. They're really severe. I had to stop using tampons MANY years ago because of the pain & tenderness I was suffering from then. And now, I haven't even considered putting anything in there- until I found these! I used to use ""Instead"" as a teen, so I figured I'd try these due to the similarities & love the idea of not having to wear a damn 'diaper' & be all messy as well as not having to shove a big, dry tampon in me while it grinds against my insides & makes my cramps MUCH worse anymore!!

So, I did try 1 at the beginning of my period (I've only had 1 since I got my initial order & had just finished it when the 2nd package arrived) & putting it in made my cramps so much worse & when I went to remove it because I didn't know how full it was, etc, I was a MESS. It had leaked, & had blood all over it, but the 'cup' didn't have any blood pooling in it. It looked exactly like the rest of the whole things did- just had blood all over it. I didn't try again. Just went back to using my huge, stinky pads.
I will definitely try again next period (whenever that'll be as I'm way irregular now, too), but I'm wondering if I didn't have it in the correct position. It was hard to keep pushing it further & further in with my severe pains all around there. Any advice??

*Also, I thought I wouldn't get my first charged shipment for 2 mos, so I'm already a bit disappointed with the company & considering canceling. I mean, I literally have only used 1 out of the initial ""trial"" pack & signed up to receive every 2 months. I didn't prepare for that payment this month & with us being on lockdown due to COVID-19, income is non-existent right now. I couldn't pay my phone bill because that $ was taken out of my acct. Unfortunately, it's dwindling down EXTREMELY FAST because money is only coming out & none is going in because of the darn coronavirus. Times are extra tough right now.
I hope you are all doing well & look forward to hearing back from you!

Take care, hun-
Jesi

"1) Is it mess-free during sex?
2) Does it really last up to 12 hours?
3) Can you do normal activities while wearing flex?",212903
"1) Is it safe to wear the flexdisc for 24 hours?

2) I don?t know how to ?bear down? on my pelvic floor to push the disc below my pelvic bone when removing. Are there more detailed instructions on this? It?s really difficult for me to remove and is uncomfortable.

3) When wearing the disc, I have to pee more than usual. Is this normal?",328704
"1) my favorite murder for podcasts, tv wise I?m usually a Disney person
2) cancer, but don?t really believe it means much, just something fun to think about
3) I think so? But also I think it?s on purpose, he had a bad divorce.

I love flex discs, I stopped taking hormonal birth control this year and flex has made it easier to manage my changing cycle and flow

Hi Victoria,

I?m Zori, your designated FLEXpert!

Things you should know about me:

1. There's nothing I love more than parmesan cheese.
2. I got my first period when I was 11. I thought I was prepared for it until it actually happened?I think I cried for about 2 whole hours; the hormones combined with the idea I'd have to deal with blood coming out of an area that was extremely confusing to me at the time for basically the rest of my life freaked me out. Can you tell I was a dramatic kid?
3. I have a really heavy flow and pretty gnarly cramps. Most months it feels like my vagina/uterus betrayed me, but I power through it because I'm a badass and so are you.
4. My first crush ever was Bill Nye the Science Guy. (Still going strong btw... it's weird, I know, stop judging me please.)

Things I'd love to know about you

1. What's your go-to tv show or podcast?
2. What's your sign?
3. Do you know whether or not Bill Nye is single?

My First Time Trying FLEX

It was pretty easy, I was scared, but quickly realized that my biggest issue was that I was overthinking it. Once I relaxed and tried it a couple time, I got it to stay in the right spot. Now, I use my FLEX discs on my lighter days, and my Flex Cup on the heavier ones.

Using discs and the cup has completely changed my definition of what TMI means; I used to be very shy, and self-conscious about my body/period. But now, I will literally have a conversation about my vagina just as casually as I'd talk about my foot or arm. I've never felt more empowered to be myself.

Let me know if you have any questions about using your disc; I've heard it all! Or if you just want to say hello, that's okay too! If you're not comfortable with reaching out to me, we have tons of helpful articles available in our FAQ. Here's a handy link (https://trk.klclick2.com/ls/click?upn=rrhvyJmnIAFv7avyRI6elE2ehM-2BcdQCawdQ6SpkT1YYGiHJ1DFPgIFDnYTFArAyR7BtD3NQSUdHOsSeOhjdnfqqPobswbBWMsz-2F9japhFvf8NptdtKVBMkidevw1y68FNff8mSjTU0zw-2F1brcEZ0cW6qe7Eh9uxFwoqrNhOFep-2F10cnLdvdgysfUvfwQ6f3H7AWdL3GwAyq0vJopiu6nyXPaoMQkXJton1RybQLRzgs0R7NmC4ofIHg9P7WQ5JHWXLL-2BwIYdaLLjhco2UWrl30ly8g2dquLURCJsTmcRZ9dWtgR2bOxzEPJ3e4qqIP6-2FHd29Wx-2BPuy1uKGP-2FWFrIDb9dVJA2WwTnK21s329DcpVXuQNh3NowRKyzrXrBiyliHyfL70k-2FJ6R-2FijM3ihd8EA-3D-3D4pm6_My9ZRny-2FQDGoGnlKXbPPr0-2BpcbQy2PyVnGvRYkR60pLyJfM9VXldzb6GiICWyNT9lml8Rodyqj16xjY-2FdD-2ByWXCqXSkVJNBiC6EXVCrYJTfFBKh8wzqClrLPjb7kERz-2FaO269rX-2FvhcfGwP4M3SLjqrhiP6S-2B5-2BjG1UDXzBmh6-2BpeVcQDK37IuBxnjG750aOcEUYsAq0TzH16C0bStgXBR8DgdYnT-2Bw14ED0wT-2BpBy45c3ycDUKbRnri28XRGYcBxrC89FLtjCW-2F3AbBAaVNoQatShJBBtrWUK2uFNnfDBHe536tnQDHLuWTDLL9MiOmKzhlUggFKL2bK4CmJmqMWzYQX6J5locFQaXu-2FJtzDFceNovLlrRF4OrcQD-2FjNCVSHoy4-2FoZDItpLb-2B0PBlPh8w-3D-3D) if you're looking for more information about insertion and removal.

"1) The Office because who doesn?t love a funny show 
2) cancer and I definitely fit the description 
3) honestly no idea, sorry! 

I?m really excited to try this product. I was using my diva cup for the longest time and I was in love with it, but I did have leaks sometimes because of my heavy flow. I now am on BC so I don?t have such a heavy flow anymore and I started using tampons again. I have seen so much about this Flex on my Instagram that I caved and decided to try it. It looks even better than my diva cup, so I?m so glad I?m one of those people who have tried it all! I love how personal this company is as well. I cannot wait to try it. $13 is a must just to try it! I couldn?t pass it up. 

Thank you :)

My First Time Trying FLEX

It was pretty easy, I was scared, but quickly realized that my biggest issue was that I was overthinking it. Once I relaxed and tried it a couple time, I got it to stay in the right spot. Now, I use my FLEX discs on my lighter days, and my Flex Cup on the heavier ones.

Using discs and the cup has completely changed my definition of what TMI means; I used to be very shy, and self-conscious about my body/period. But now, I will literally have a conversation about my vagina just as casually as I'd talk about my foot or arm. I've never felt more empowered to be myself.

-I didn?t know there was a flex cup. How does that work? I?m pretty heavy flow also with the disc I have to wear a pad under it cause I leak. My first time using it I panicked when I couldn?t find it to take out and my husband had to get it out for me. Since then I only use it on my heaviest days and my husband still helps me get it out cause I can?t ever find it. He thinks I?m being a baby but we?re close enough he doesn?t mind taking it out for me lol tmi I know.

I tried a menstrual cup before I had kids, and the company offered different sizes depending on whether or not you had kids vaginally. 3) Most importantly, will the product work for me if I have a moderate prolapse (bladder and rectum bulge out and sit at the vaginal entrance without coming out. I regularly use my pessary if I exercise). My cervix sits pretty low, about half finger into the vagina due to prolapse. Will Flex Disc be comfortable? I tried a cervical diaphragm (Caya) for contraception after I had kids, and it didn't feel good or comfortable. Thanks!

My First Time Trying FLEX

It was pretty easy, I was scared, but quickly realized that my biggest issue was that I was overthinking it. Once I relaxed and tried it a couple time, I got it to stay in the right spot. Now, I use my FLEX discs on my lighter days, and my Flex Cup on the heavier ones.

Using discs and the cup has completely changed my definition of what TMI means; I used to be very shy, and self-conscious about my body/period. But now, I will literally have a conversation about my vagina just as casually as I'd talk about my foot or arm. I've never felt more empowered to be myself.

Please can you cancel this order, I haven't ordered it & thought I was taking place in a trial only. I am a single parent in a very vulnerable finacial situation at the moment so please can you take that into consideration and issue a refund and cancel any subscriptions that I was unaware were in place.

"3 questions: I use nuvaring and i noticed after using my first disc that it pulled out my ring when i took it out.  Is that normal or should I be inserting them differently? 
2) I had my first one in for 8 hours on day 3 and I feel like barely anything was in there.  Normal or do you think I had it inserted incorrectly?
3) it was painful to remove.  Tips?  I removed it 20 min ago and i'm still slightly uncomfortable.

Hi Cheyenne,

We have some great news for you! We?ve heard from our customers that $45 charged quarterly can be cost prohibitive so we?ve updated our subscription to be charged monthly to help offset the cost.

There is no action required for you. Once your trial period is over, you?ll automatically be switched over to an 8 pack shipped and billed monthly at $15.ÿThis change will be reflected on your account page within 48 hours. If you need more than 8 discs per month let us know and we?ll hook you up.

Our goal at The Flex Company is to deliver life changing period products to everyone. We?re constantly working to fulfill that mission and want to make sure you always have FLEX on hand when you need it.

Thank you for being such an awesome customer.

Thanks,

"8 is not enough for my entire cycle, using 2 per 24 hour timeframe only covers a 4 day cycle. Mine is 4-6 days long. How do I order more discs? I would like to just order a large box of like 100. 

These discs are awesome, where have they been my whole life? This was literally the most comfortable, convienent period I have EVER had. No uncomfortable tampons, leakage, odor, less cramping and as a bonus was able to have sex with my partner with the disc in and it did not cause discomfort to either one of us.

Dear Ms. Lauren Schulte and Ms. Erika Jensen,

My name is Charlotte Kim, and I am writing to invite both of you to be speakers at the Harvard Undergraduate Women in Business Intercollegiate Business Convention (IBC) on Sunday, October 28, 2018 at the Sheraton Boston hotel.

With over 400 members, Harvard Undergraduate Women in Business is the largest undergraduate business organization at Harvard College. Our mission is to empower a dynamic group of enterprising young women by uniting them through business education and experience. Every fall, Harvard Undergraduate Women in Business hosts approximately 1,000 undergraduate students from more than 100 universities worldwide for the Intercollegiate Business Convention (IBC), a day of focused programming for driven female leaders to explore career opportunities, expand their network of peers and mentors, and be inspired by top business leaders.

We are committed to making our 14th convention the best IBC yet, which is why we would be thrilled to have one or both of you, depending on your availability, as panelists on our Entrepreneurship panel, which will have 150 attendees.

Our board has nominated you as IBC Panelists, because your positions as Co-Founders of The Flex Company have allowed girls everywhere to aspire to positions of leadership. Throughout your careers, you have consistently reached new standards of achievement in packaging and branding. You are inspirations to young women who want to do meaningful and empowering work, and HUWIB would be honored if you would share insight into the requirements for success in the business world.

In addition to the breakout sessions, we will also be holding a networking and mentorship lunch so that attendees can directly interact with professionals. If you are available, we would also love for you to join in this activity.

For more information about Harvard Undergraduate Women In Business or IBC, please visit our website at http://huwib.com/.

Thank you in advance for your consideration, and please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions. I look forward to hearing from you!
 
Sincerely,

Charlotte Kim

Hi there, I work for Creekside and we have 7 providers. I have been raving about your product for a few months now and I am slowly getting more and more coworkers to try the flex. They love the product as well!!! Do you do any brochures or samples?  Something that would help spread the word about this awesome product to our patients and friends and family of patients that would be in the office? We would love to hear back from you!

 

 

HUGE FANS!!!

Thank You!

To whom it may concern,

Looking to increase sales while helping women during their menstruation? On average, a woman has her period from 3-7 days and the average woman menstruates from age 13 until age 51.
Women today have an estimated 450 periods in their lifetime. Multiply that by 7, that's 3,150 days a women menstruates for. Unfortunately, many women are misguided and misinformed by the product they need or will need. Many believe they cannot afford the products but this will help women see which benefits them to their ideal comfort and budget.

 My name is Jazmine E. Morales and I am looking for sponsorships to help build my project to inform and guide all women of all ages of the feminine products they need or will need during their menstruation as well as improve sales for your business. Together we can create an environment where women can explore their options of the different feminine products you have to offer and that are being released by giving samples, pamphlets, and any information on your products. If you are interested in my project or have any questions please contact me to any of the information listed above. Thank you for your time.


Sincerely,

Jazmine E. Morales",22219

Re: FLEX COMPANY                                                                                                 

 

Dear Vendor/Broker,   

 

Albertsons Companies electronically transmits ALL invoices starting with a ?P? or ?D? on your check remit via an email link utilizing DemandTec?s eDeals system on a daily basis. We are requesting that you review the following information and respond back only if an email address change is required.

 

We currently have HELLO@FLEXFITS.COM as an email address for your company or broker where Albertsons Companies invoices are sent via IBM Deal Management. Please reply to this communication with an updated email address if the email address identified above is incorrect so that we can update our system with the correct email address for invoices delivered from DemandTec.

 

* Invoices starting with a ?D? are most commonly used for invoices for short shipments, cost errors, paper invoice charges, and freight charges. Invoices starting with a ?P? are for promotional allowances.

ú         Our system only allows for one email address for all invoices sent via DemandTec. We highly recommend you set up a group email address such as AR@xxxxxx.com (maximum of 30 characters which includes domain name) or set up an email rule on your end if multiple folks need to get copies of invoices. A generic email address is preferred. Many companies are creating generic email addresses for accepting invoices so that there is no disruption to the delivery of invoices when staffing changes occur or a staff member is on vacation, sick, etc.

 

Please consider the following when providing an email for invoice distribution:

 

1.     Almost all of the invoices sent via DemandTec are deduction invoices and usually will go to a vendor?s Accounts Receivable department or Deduction Department.

 

2.     We have noticed that some vendors are not receiving invoices because their email box is ?FULL?. Please make sure your IT department sets your email box size settings to accommodate the volume of invoices/communication received. This will ensure that you receive all invoices and communication and eliminates asking for copies of invoices to be resent again.

 

3.     We are requesting one generic group email box if you are the assigned broker for the receipt of ALL DIVISIONS for ALL of your vendor?s invoices generated from DemandTec for Albertsons Companies.

 

ú         Replies, vacation messages, out of office, or bounce back messages to DemandTec email address at noreply@demandtec.com are not monitored. Requests to update email addresses should be sent to AVISS ticketing system (see instructions below).

 

ú         Our system requires that the email address be 30 or less characters in length.

 

ú         At this time, DemandTec invoices can only be sent to one email address for ALL divisions. We recommend that DemandTec invoices go directly to the vendor if there are multiple brokers representing the same vendor.

* Invoices are sent from noreply@demandtec.com.

 

* If you are not receiving invoices at this email address from DemandTec your IT Department may be accidentally blocking the emails sent from DemandTec due to increasing security of your inbound email.

 

1. In order to successfully receive your Albertsons Companies invoices we recommend that you forward this email to your IT team and request them to whitelist emails from the following domains so that emails are not being blocked by your email system.

**** @demandtec.com

**** Please have your IT department check for IP address: 165.193.47.4

1. Please make sure this email address is flagged as ?not junk? in your email.

2. If you are missing an invoice, please check your SPAM/Junk folder to make sure invoices are not routed to this folder before requesting copies of invoices.

3. Please contact DemandTec/ IBM Deal Management for further assistance if you have any further questions or concerns with the delivery of invoices.

Please see the following information concerning vendor inquiries and backup requests:

Albertsons recently implemented a ticketing system for inquiries or backup requests. Please open a ticket in AVISS and your ticket will be routed to the team that can provide answers to inquiry or the backup you are requesting.

 

Albertsons is continually looking for opportunities to improve service to our vendors. Albertsons will be implementing a new ticketing system (AVISS) allowing vendors to submit tickets for new inquiries and disputes. The ticketing system will allow us to centralize vendor inquiries, route them to the appropriate departments in a timely manner and track the progression of each ticket.

AVISS was designed to assist with the high volume of Accounts Payable and Allowance Billing related inquires; however, it will not address all vendor inquiries.

AVISS will support the following inquiries:

ú         Vendor Account Maintenance - Name, Address, Email, etc.

ú         Short Payment/Deduction Inquiries and Disputes

ú         Missing Invoice Payments

ú         General Accounts Payable/Allowance Billing Inquiries

AVISS will not support the following:

ú         Procurement Inquiries

ú         Negotiations of Pricing, Allowances or Payment Terms

ú         Supply Chain Inquiries

 

Vendors are now required to submit a ticket for inquiries and disputes through our APEX Vendor Self-Service Portal OR through the AVISS portal.

To submit NEW inquiries, login to APEX at https://albertsons.apexportal.net/ or visit the AVISS portal at www.AlbertsonsCompanies.com/AVISS

 

We thank you for your continued support as we strive to provide the best service possible.

 

Please feel free to contact me if you have any further questions.

Re: FLEX COMPANY {CPS}                                                                                                   

 

Dear Vendor/Broker,   

 

Albertsons Companies electronically transmits ALL invoices starting with a ?P?, ?D?, ?ALW? on your check remit via an email link utilizing DemandTec?s eDeals system on a daily basis. We are requesting that you review the following information and respond back only if an email address change is required.

 

We currently have HELLO@FLEXFITS.COM as an email address for your company or broker where Albertsons Companies invoices are sent via Acoustic?s DemandTec Deal Management system. Please reply to this communication with an updated email address if the email address identified above is incorrect so that we can update our system with the correct email address for invoices delivered from DemandTec.

 

* Invoices starting with a ?D? are most commonly used for invoices for short shipments, cost errors, paper invoice charges, and freight charges. Invoices starting with a ?P? or ?ALW? are for promotional allowances.

ú         Our system only allows for one email address for all invoices sent via DemandTec. We highly recommend you set up a group email address such as AR@xxxxxx.com (maximum of 30 characters which includes domain name) or set up an email rule on your end if multiple folks need to get copies of invoices. A generic email address is preferred. Many companies are creating generic email addresses for accepting invoices so that there is no disruption to the delivery of invoices when staffing changes occur or a staff member is on vacation, sick, etc.

 

Please consider the following when providing an email for invoice distribution:

 

1.     Almost all of the invoices sent via DemandTec are deduction invoices and usually will go to a vendor?s Accounts Receivable Department or Deduction Department.

 

2.     We have noticed that some vendors are not receiving invoices because their email box is ?FULL?. Please make sure your IT department sets your email box size settings to accommodate the volume of invoices/communication received. This will ensure that you receive all invoices and communication and eliminates asking for copies of invoices to be resent again.

 

3.     We are requesting one generic group email box if you are the assigned broker for the receipt of ALL DIVISIONS for ALL of your vendor?s invoices generated from DemandTec for Albertsons Companies.

 

ú         Replies, vacation messages, out of office, or bounce back messages to DemandTec email address at noreply@demandtec.com are not monitored. Requests to update email addresses should be sent to AVISS ticketing system (see instructions below).

 

ú         Our system requires that the email address be 30 or less characters in length.

 

ú         At this time, DemandTec invoices can only be sent to one email address for ALL divisions. We recommend that DemandTec invoices go directly to the vendor if there are multiple brokers representing the same vendor.

* Invoices are sent from noreply@demandtec.com.

 

* If you are not receiving invoices at this email address from DemandTec your IT Department may be accidentally blocking the emails sent from DemandTec due to increasing security of your inbound email.

 

1. In order to successfully receive your Albertsons Companies invoices we recommend that you forward this email to your IT team and request them to whitelist emails from the following domains so that emails are not being blocked by your email system.

**** @demandtec.com

**** Please have your IT department check for IP address: 165.193.47.4

1. Please make sure this email address is flagged as ?not junk? in your email.

2. If you are missing an invoice, please check your SPAM/Junk folder to make sure invoices are not routed to this folder before requesting copies of invoices.

3. Please contact DemandTec/ IBM Deal Management for further assistance if you have any further questions or concerns with the delivery of invoices.

*** Email: dtsupport@acoustic.com

*** Phone: Toll Free in U.S. 1-866-820-5136

 

Please see the following information concerning vendor inquiries and backup requests:

Albertsons implemented a ticketing system for inquiries or backup requests. Please open a ticket in AVISS and your ticket will be routed to the team that can provide answers to inquiry or the backup you are requesting.

 

Albertsons is continually looking for opportunities to improve service to our vendors. Albertsons will be implementing a new ticketing system (AVISS) allowing vendors to submit tickets for new inquiries and disputes. The ticketing system will allow us to centralize vendor inquiries, route them to the appropriate departments in a timely manner and track the progression of each ticket.

AVISS was designed to assist with the high volume of Accounts Payable and Allowance Billing related inquires; however, it will not address all vendor inquiries.

AVISS will support the following inquiries:

ú         Vendor Account Maintenance - Name, Address, Email, etc.

ú         Short Payment/Deduction Inquiries and Disputes

ú         Missing Invoice Payments

ú         General Accounts Payable/Allowance Billing Inquiries

AVISS will not support the following:

ú         Procurement Inquiries

ú         Negotiations of Pricing, Allowances or Payment Terms

ú         Supply Chain Inquiries

 

Vendors are now required to submit a ticket for inquiries and disputes through our APEX Vendor Self-Service Portal OR through the AVISS portal.

To submit NEW inquiries, login to APEX at https://albertsons.apexportal.net/ or visit the AVISS portal at www.AlbertsonsCompanies.com/AVISS

 

We thank you for your continued support as we strive to provide the best service possible.

 

Please feel free to contact me if you have any further questions.

Hello,
 I meant to change the date on the order shipment today but I don?t think it saved because it still shipped today. 

Can you please cancel this order and refund it and Change the shipping date to April 1st instead?

Good Afternoon- 

I received a notification that my order is shipped. It?s going to the wrong address. No message was sent letting me know it was going out or I would?ve corrected it. I?m an active duty service member and moved recently. Can this be corrected since no notification was received before it was just shipped?

1. How high is your cup inserted based on the photo below? 

- In between #2 & #3 (especially when mildly bearing down to have bowel movement)

2. You mentioned having struggles with other brands of cups:

2a. What struggles did you have?

- Similar issues as with the large Flex cup
- Do not think I thought to try out smaller cup or I did and was struggling with that size too (maybe because of my heavy clot like period) and it was when cups first came around the market)

2b. Were the cups too big, migrating up or down the vaginal canal? 

-More migrating down, never up.
-Not sure how to gauze ?too big? but I don?t think so.  Rather the mechanism of insert hard, especially because it was either a messy process (especially while on period and forced to use public restrooms, and/or there was no lubrication on products (including disk), which causes significant challenges and discomfort.

3. Out of all the brands and different types of period ?catchers,? I have had the best success with your Flex discs, even though: (1) it?s a messy process changing, (2) no lubricant causes discomfort and at times pain (eg. snags on labia folds on insertion), (3) making it a two hand process, (4) thus rarely able work with in public, (5) limits my freedom and (6) increasing my anxiety (ex. bleeding through clothes), (7) so hyper fixated and unable to go about my day (ex. unable to complete the simplest of activities of daily living, run errands etc.), (8) forced to remove and go back to using a pad, and (9) not having a release ring or string to pull; knowing I was going to have to digitally remove, which was a production in itself.

4. Why have you/Sima choose cup vs. disk for me?

Dear all, 

I am Susanna Sandrelli, I am an independent midwife based in Turin (Italy). 
I work for a private birth centre based in Turin (casa Maternit… Prima Luce - unfortunately the website is only in Italian! https://casaprimaluce.it (https://casaprimaluce.it/) ). 
Together with my colleagues we have organised a workshop in October to discuss sustainable alternatives to the classic period pads, for example the menstrual cups. The workshop is free for our associates. During this workshop, I would like to show them some of your lovely products, would it be possible to have some of your samples and maybe some of your leaflets to advertise your products please? I would love to show them that a more sustainable life is possible and how to save Mother Earth! 
Please do not hesitate to contact me for any queries. 

Many thanks in advance

Good Morning,

I ordered the Flex Discs via PayPal on Tuesday the 25th. I have the confirmation from Paypal for the recurring Payment to your company, but I don?t have a confirmation from you. I went to login (I set up an account with a password at the time of transaction) and it didn?t recognize my e-mail address. I?m assuming I made a typo on my e-mail or something, but I don?t have an order confirmation number due to not receiving the confirmation email from you. I do have the Paypal transaction ID if that?s of any use to you. Please let me know, as I was trying to track the shipment hoping it would be here by tomorrow evening. Thank you.

My life has been forever changed by Flex! I have had 27 years of periods (that?s over 1600 days of bleeding and nasty tampons) and have never had such an amazing time during my period until I used your product last week ON MY HONEYMOON in Jamaica! 

It was truly meant to be because about 2 weeks before my honeymoon I saw your add on Facebook and clicked it to get more info. I didn't actually believe Flex would or could do all it claimed to be able to do but I ordered it anyways. Mostly because I was certain most of my 7 day honeymoon in Jamaica would be spent with me on my period which was definitely not ok with me. This is my second marriage and also second honeymoon and on my first honeymoon in 2001 I also had my period...talk about luck...haha. I didn?t want the same thing to happen with my new, amazing husband. I wondered if I?d have problems with insertion because of the detailed pamphlet in the box in addition to the fact that the Flex looks like something that could be used as a snack bowl. But I didn?t have any problems at all. It went in correctly right away and not even 1 drop of blood leaked and I?ve had 3 large babies and figured if it leaked with anyone it would be me. Removal was just as easy and I love the murder scene analogy from your website but it went well since I did everything over the toilet. And your claim is right....mess free period sex- so wonderful and a huge perk to having it on my honeymoon while living in a bikini for a week! 

Your product has changed the way I view my periods and I am forever grateful. I am a teacher by schooling and have taught (high school, middle school and elementary school) for years and have also been in sales and owned my own company. I am now a part time fitness instructor and love to make a difference in the lives of others. I don?t know where you need help in your company but I want to work for your company so other women can find out about and buy this amazing product decades before I discovered it. 

You can find personal info about me on Alaina Tyson on Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/alainaclark6  (https://www.facebook.com/alainaclark6)  )  and @alainatyson3 on Instagram. I can talk today at noon and tomorrow at noon also. My number is 857-526-3869. I look forward to getting Flex into the hands of every woman! 

Thank you!

Hello Zori!

1. My go to network is hgtv 
2. I?m a Capricorn
3. Sadly, I don?t know if he?s single or taken

I?m really looking forward to trying flex. My sister recommended it to me especially after having to change my tampon on a boat in the middle of the lake this past weekend because it was my first period day and I?m heavy in the first 48hrs! Talk about a new experience haha. 

So, I am looking forward to trying flex and the flexibility it will bring me to not have to worry about changing a tampon constantly the first 48hrs when my period is heaviest. I?m also so happy that I won?t have to worry about TSS. I am a little nervous as to making sure I get the positioning of it correct but just like anything new, it?s going to take practice until I?m comfortable and more confident with what I?m doing. 

I ordered flex during my period so I haven?t received it yet but will be looking forward to trying it next month.

Hi Laura,

I?m Zori, your designated FLEXpert!

Things you should know about me:

1. There's nothing I love more than parmesan cheese.
2. I got my first period when I was 11. I thought I was prepared for it until it actually happened?I think I cried for about 2 whole hours; the hormones combined with the idea I'd have to deal with blood coming out of an area that was extremely confusing to me at the time for basically the rest of my life freaked me out. Can you tell I was a dramatic kid?
3. I have a really heavy flow and pretty gnarly cramps. Most months it feels like my vagina/uterus betrayed me, but I power through it because I'm a badass and so are you.
4. My first crush ever was Bill Nye the Science Guy. (Still going strong btw... it's weird, I know, stop judging me please.)

Things I'd love to know about you

1. What's your go-to tv show or podcast?
2. What's your sign?
3. Do you know whether or not Bill Nye is single?

My First Time Trying FLEX

It was pretty easy, I was scared, but quickly realized that my biggest issue was that I was overthinking it. Once I relaxed and tried it a couple time, I got it to stay in the right spot. Now, I use my FLEX discs on my lighter days, and my Flex Cup on the heavier ones.

Using discs and the cup has completely changed my definition of what TMI means; I used to be very shy, and self-conscious about my body/period. But now, I will literally have a conversation about my vagina just as casually as I'd talk about my foot or arm. I've never felt more empowered to be myself.

Let me know if you have any questions about using your disc; I've heard it all! Or if you just want to say hello, that's okay too! If you're not comfortable with reaching out to me, we have tons of helpful articles available in our FAQ. Here's a handy link (https://trk.klclick1.com/ls/click?upn=rrhvyJmnIAFv7avyRI6elE2ehM-2BcdQCawdQ6SpkT1YYGiHJ1DFPgIFDnYTFArAyRIXxJ60u0ABY9rAiqZLdsE5rkEXa3lfTwedIRUgK3Y-2Bhfx7wUWmZixYG4kzjfrKjwepraMwuOxL46So7qdE4nGLBwzHMfZFBgpuJ2O8Hc6S0yhGE2WruAz7AFHR8oRjM9ha7sDUpeyFcqRtmmldGgRiJsBxVTs3gCZJMCkCmWInRqOa6cdJeNnqbrJ5QInV6dXwSWUj3pxPqkObaCs5jQxmMisqKaVjBclkgH5KclEeSoIyQzhu6cKFJrq0myWnA4sLpxhkIYKAuAutnP2MUIvu-2B0ThIoj7n2Q9yP6x4BGCn-2Bbx4rVoMkwez2kUQTVaSbfERSO1ZhvZQTbpyVq5BZqc9Wgu4Usxj9wiG29Y6g18icT-2BrsS5nvWulzqTYWMYyhE8PfQvb2E11BZdrgucBsHx-2BcFv-2FZ-2BHwXgqOdE0ec68c-3DmEzK_idm-2F9Puv3rod4ptT-2BddOeNNZ-2FTkuxoj-2BZpFbi9eWvq0Swz0bmyUGIYeQBMOs-2F6gUQQqfpH-2BArGcFyrJQEBmsJ6V9ty61F6GDQMib8mpjkff-2FIn5Jwl-2BJKLwGSUqCT35l2HPqFvYr3Ilz3jlnkrq8ZrehZC-2BYZmOUUZZFZawVuj3DprIzI-2BEc7jdGNEdTeEENd91WdGfxPHUDhdoDQKdSgqgTiHxSUh0ECrCrqin37h96x-2B4HfQqfzMiC-2FL0lVp-2BjqQ3N6Sbx43HwvrtegI0yHPrWQ6GrqSTCPykBxOcq75NfP-2FxCWVWXYJRKr9EAEH9WLqIeA8FGAYrZRSBUK2lE0NL7Wls1S5QzLr4Xyhueu8oKWSvjAb8miiulSxmvGGEdLM-2BzvNaNuQplnIOR6SlK-2BA-3D-3D) if you're looking for more information about insertion and removal.

Hello,

I recently bought your flex cup in July of this past year, and my pull string is now breaking. I am no longer able to pull on the string. I paid a decent amount of money to obtain your one of a kind product and I very much enjoy it, but I don?t think it would be appropriate to buy a new one since this one was supposed to last me around two years and it?s been a half a year. I will send you my cup, if you would like, for proof. I have also attached my order confirmation and tracking information. I can forward the emails if you would like as well for further proof.

I recently purchased your product for the first time. The box indicates that there should have been more detailed instructions inside. Though the box was sealed thoroughly, there was no insert beyond the softdiscs themselves. I've attached a picture of the SKU code for the box I purchased. In addition, when I went to the website to view the tutorial, the video never loaded with sound and the site itself was extremely slow and non-responsive.

?Hello, I?ve had several issues with my latest order. Firstly, I was traveling abroad and was trying to see if it would be possible to ship it to Germany. Even though it was supposed to be possible, the website was having trouble recognize the address and was insisting that there be a state inputted. Since there aren?t any states in Germany, I wasn?t able to use the online system and had to go through customer service. I was then told the order wouldn?t make it in time though, so I said nevermind. Well it looks like my shipping address was changed in the system permanently at that point by customer service even though I didn?t realize it and the next order was mistakenly shipped to Germany. (Which could have been a problem except that friend I was visiting has now become my boyfriend and I?ll be visiting again soon so it?s ok if it still goes there.) However, now we come to the next problem. According to the tracking history, DHL apparently had trouble with the address, then tried redelivery and supposedly succeeded, except that he did not receive the order and I have no idea who did. What I suspect could be the issue is that in Germany, instead of having  apartment numbers, they just go by the name. If his name (which is in my account info with the address) was left off of the delivery address (as it looks it might have been) DHL would have no idea which apartment in the building to ring. So I don?t know who they gave it to but it was not me and it was not him. 

If Flex wants to be an international player, they should be aware how addresses work in other countries and allow that to be reflected in their online system as well as shipping procedure, especially considering that there is an extra charge associated, in my case, $10 for a lot of trouble and attempts at tracking down a still undelivered package and yet another menstrual cycle in which I cannot use the product I paid for. So just to clarify, the order must have his name on the package (Wolfgang Paradeiser), even more importantly than mine, if it is going to that address in Germany.

Here was the tracking for the order:
GM605116851000089123

If this is not going to be possible to ship to Germany after all, and it can be shipped immediately to an American address instead, you can use my own Virginia address, 85 Hopkins, same as Billing. (In which case it needs to be my name.) But I would not be able to receive it there after Feb 6. And in that case I still would have overpaid $10 international shipping, so I?m not sure what to do at this point. I really like the product, but this whole process has been more trouble than it?s worth. 

Any advice you have for next steps would be appreciated. Thank you!

Best,

"? Hello,

Today is my first day for trying to flex! I had worn it for approximately eight hours and then discovered leaking.  Do you have any tips to prevent that? After reading through the hand out that came with the product, it mentioned something about the push method for the heaviest day. I was curious as to how effective this method was.   Also, when you put it in, is it best to push the sack out or not? I am so new to this. It did not seem like mine was full by any means, it just seemed like it had leaked around it and that maybe I did not have a good enough seal.

Thanks for your help!

Hey,

I?ve had my flex cup for 2 months and I LOVE it! I don?t dread my period like I used to.  

I am having leakage issues though. The stem is pulled through correctly. I?ve tried the different folds, but on heavier days I still have to wear a pad. 

I clean out the flex cup every 3 hours or so on my heavier days. Once my heavier days are over I?m good with a panty liner and can leave the cup in for 12 hours without it filling up, but I still have some minor leakage. 

I don?t mind that so much because panty liners don?t bother me. However, I was hoping that by switching to the cup I could completely eliminate having to wear a pad. After reading up on the flex cup, I feel like I am doing something wrong and can correct this. 

Please let me know if you have any suggestions! 

Thank you very much!

Hi there,

I purchased the Flexcup on 9/2/19 (CUP9634).  I've been using this product for the last few months and while I'm still getting the hang of it, I am definitely not going back to anything else! A few days ago, things were going fine and I was using it as I normally would, but when I went to remove it, the loop broke while it was still inserted! You can imagine my dismay and sheer panic in trying to remove it. It was definitely a very scary experience. After several minutes, I was able to remove it and I noticed that the loop was broken at the tip.. so you are no longer able to pull the loop down for removal. Obviously, this is no longer usable and am very concerned about the longevity and durability of the cup. That being said, I would love to get a new one and hope it was just a fluke with mine. 

I spoke to Stephanie Smith who requested for me to send an email in order to escalate this issue. Attached you will find two pictures of the broken tip, as mentioned. Thank you for your understanding and time in addressing this issue. 

All the best,
Frances

Hi Zori!
I?m excited about trying Flex, but have strangely specific questions. When inserting the disk, do I insert it as if I?m angling for my butt? Also, I have PCOS and spot almost daily. I bought the disks thinking they would help with odor and discharge. Am I correct in my thinking, or is this just a period product?
Thank you for any help you can give me!

it might be an unhealthy obsession, but life's short do

I thought I was prepared for it until it actually happened?I think I cried for about 2 whole hours; the hormones combined with the idea I'd have to deal with blood coming out of an area that was extremely confusing to me at the time for basically the rest of my life freaked me out. Can you tell I was a dramatic kid?

and pretty gnarly cramps. Most months it feels like my vagina/uterus betrayed me, but I power through it because I'm a badass and so are you.

Hi, I recently bought a flex cup, and based on the recommendations, I went with a slim fit. But it is so uncomfortable each time I wear it and it constantly feels like it is slipping down. When I bought it it said I could switch it out for a different size if it didn?t work. Can I switch it out for a full fit? I think that would work much better for me.

Hi!

I purchased a flex cup slim, however it caused me leakage -- in public! I reached out, but to the wrong e-mail, and ended up purchasing another flex cup (regular fit) from my local CVS. I was hoping I could be refunded for my flex cup slim. I also have the receipt from the new flex cup I bought today (my period is due any second, lol).

Hi!

I've had the Flex Cup for about a year now and absolutely love it!!!! Completely obsessed with it and it has changed my life so much - in a great way. 

One tiny problem though, the other day my Release Ring basically snapped and came apart :( I'm attaching a picture below but it has been causing some problems pulling the ring out. Just wanted to let you know and see if there was any kind of credit I could access to buy another one!

It's well known that the key to a successful eCommerce business is generating fresh leads while building a presence on social media. With 15,000+ followers on social media and countless Facebook ads, nothing has generated me more money than email marketing... and here is why.

1. Did you know that it's 10 times more expensive to acquire a new customer compared to selling to a current one? 
2. Did you know that Repeat customers spend on average 67% more than new ones?
3. You're literally sitting on an untapped gold mine that can increase your business by 15 - 30%.


This is blowing my mind. I've been networking with a ton of business owners and almost NO one is doing email marketing.

My Challenge: Let me manage your email marketing for 1 month completely FREE and get you 15-30% more sales from your current customers (while keeping your brand and message intact). This is totally turnkey and free as well. You get a boost in business and I get a great testimonial for mine? Let me know if this interests you!

Thank you,

"ÿ ÿ Hi there, in interested in purchasing a flex, but before I do, I have some concerns. Hopefully you guys can address them and help me out.
ÿ ÿ ÿI regularly wear pads. I find them comfortable and hassle free. I dont use tampons often, only when I want to swim. But when I wear tampons, they feel so uncomfortable and hurt, and I leak.ÿ
ÿ ÿ ÿI seen how the flex is and it looks pretty cool. And what really calls my attention is the clean sex. But before i get one, i want to know....how do you insert it? If I have issues with tampons, will I have issues with the flex? How do I take the flex out without making a horrible mess? Does it have to be removed to pee? Is this good for a heavy flow?ÿ

My name is Lilian Uwanyuze, I am a model and a Pre-med student based in NY/NJ. I?ve been following the FLEX brand for about 2 years, and recently, I decided to purchase the discs for the first time. As I?m sure you?re aware, such consideration is not taken lightly.ÿ

ÿ

Having used tampons my entire menstrual life thus far, I had to get over my initial hesitation of trying them. WHAT A MIRACLE. Not sure what else can say, JUST WOW. With a tampon, I normally changed my tampon 6 plus times in a 24-hour span, with flex this has changed to 2 to 3 times. I will admit my first-day using flex disc was a bit nerve-wracking, especially taking out my first one. I thought it was stuck and I panicked a bit, thinking I may have to go to the hospital to have the disc removed. Though the removal was a challenge it felt extremely comfortable the moment I inserted the 1st disc.ÿ

ÿ

I?m reaching out to open a dialogue and potentially build further relations with FLEX. My desire is an opportunity to utilize my platform to bring more awareness to your brand. I was born in Rwanda and raised between Uganda, Los Angeles & New York City. I have seen and experienced quality differences between the two continents. What women in America consider to be basic essential for others is a luxury in other parts of the world. The convenience I found in using and the amount I needed thru out the day made realize how much my sisters around the world could benefit from your very own product. While having worked within the art, entertainment & media landscapes and currently as a pre-med major with all intentions to go Med School thereafter. I believe that I have a rather unique narrative, perspective, and audience. I look forward to your reply. Thank you again for your consideration!

ÿ

Congratulations on executing an excellent brand both in quality and eco friendly

ÿ

Until then!

Hi Becca,

I saw that your first order of FLEX was delivered (hooray!).

Once you learn how to use FLEX you?ll have: 


	
	A workday free of product changes
	
	
	Less cramping and leaking 
	
	
	Workouts where all you have to worry about is pushing yourself harder
	
	
	Clean sheets from mess-free period sex
	
	
	The most comfortable period of your life 
	


For this first cycle I recommend checking out my top 10 tips & tricks and watch Lauren and me talk about how to insert it below. 





Can?t wait to hear how it goes,

Erika

ÿ

PS Remember, you don?t have to be on your period to try FLEX for the first time. Get comfortable with FLEX by practicing insertion and removal (or even having sex with it!) before you start your period.

Hi Irina Moya,
Uh oh. Your card was declined when we attempted to charge you for this month?s shipment of FLEX. We don?t want to leave you empty handed (or worse: having to go back to tampons).
Update your card by clicking here and we?ll get your shipment out in a jiffy.

Hi Elizabeth,
I?m Erika, cofounder of The Flex Company - nice to e-meet you! I wanted to personally welcome you to the Flex family. We?re on a mission to create body-positive, life-changing experiences through the products that we make and the conversations that we spark. Our vision is to reimagine and deliver life-changing period products everywhere. Thank you for helping us get there.You?ve now committed to a 90 day challenge to change the way you live life during your period. During that time I?m going to send you 10 emails which will:    
   - Give you transparency into our team and our products
   - Teach you how to use a menstrual disc
   - Lay out the common pain points & how to work through them
   - Provide you access to a real person (her name is Kate) for additional help
   - Give you ideas on what to do with all the time you?ll get back
   - Teach you a bit more about how FLEX measures up against tampons
   - Notify you of your upcoming charge & shipment
Until then be patient with yourself, try to have a little fun and know that I?m here whenever you need me. We?re in this together now.Cheers,Erika

We're Listening
We believe that building a better period starts with listening to what people with periods have to say?your experience is important to us!
 |

 |


| 
|  |

 |


| 
| 
Here's how to use them:
 |

 |


| 
|  |

 |


| 
| 
With clean hands, slip the pouch on your hand like a glove.
 |

 |


| 
|  |

 |


| 
| 
Remove the disc as normal.
** Tip: If you can't reach the rim of your disc, place your index finger in the corner of the bag **
 |

 |


| 
|  |

 |


| 
| 
As you remove the disc, use your other hand to pull the open flap of the pouch over the disc, securing the disc and mensesÿinside.
 |

 |


| 
|  |

 |


| 
| 
Use the adhesive strip to seal the pouch shut.
 |

 Hi Damaris! I?m Zori, your designated Flexpert.Why We Were Matched Up / My Period Profile   
   - I used to use a menstrual cup, which gave me lots-o-extra time but ended up being painful and needy. FLEX gave me my life back without the hurt - I actually can?t feel it at all.ÿ
   - I have a really heavy flow (I fill a super tampon in 1-3 hours) and cramps that felt like a mosh pit in my stomach.
Things You Should Know About Me   
   - I started my period when I was 10 at a waterpark and was so confused! My mom wasn?t there and my dad got to handle it (like a champ, might I add).
   - I?m an avid runner and love being outside - movement is everything.
   - I grew up in a super small town. It has a population of just over 3,000, most of which are my family.
My First Time Trying FLEXI tried FLEX on my heaviest day and found what looked like a war-zone in my chonies. Yes, leaks can happen while you're getting used to FLEX.

Hi rebecca,

I?m Zori, your designated Flexpert!

Things you should know about me
   
   - There's nothing I love more than parmesan cheese.
   - I got my first period when I was 11. I thought I was prepared for it until it actually happened?I think I cried for about 2 whole hours; the hormones combined with the idea I'd have to deal with bloodÿcoming out of an area that was extremely confusing to me at the time for basically the rest of my life freaked me out. Can you tell I was a dramatic kid?ÿ
   - I have a really heavy flow and pretty gnarly cramps. Most months it feels like my vagina/uterus betrayed me, but I power through it because I'm a badass and so are you.
   - My first crush ever was Bill Nye the Science Guy. (Still going strong btw... it's weird, I know, stop judging meÿplease.)

Things I'd love to know about you:
   
   - What's your go-to tv show or podcast?
   - What's your sign?
   - Do you know whether or not Bill Nye is single?



My First Time Trying FLEX

It was pretty easy, I was scared, but quickly realized that my biggest issue was that I was overthinking it. Once I relaxed and tried it a couple time, I got it to stay in the right spot. Now, I use my FLEX discs on my lighter days, and my Flex Cup on the heavier ones.

Using discs and the cup has completely changed my definition of what TMI means; I used to be very shy, and self-conscious about my body/period. But now, I will literally have a conversation about my vagina just as casually as I'd talk about my foot orÿarm. I've never felt more empowered to be myself.ÿ

Let me know if you have any questions about using your disc; I've heard it all! Or if you just want to say hello, that's okay too! If you're not comfortable with reaching out to me, we have tons of helpful articles available in ourÿFAQ. Here's a handy link if you're looking forÿmore information about insertion and removal. I hope you end up lovin' your discs!ÿ

Hey there,

I'm Erika, cofounder of The Flex Company - nice to e-meet you!

I saw that you left FLEX in your cart and I wanted to reach out to see if you had any questions.

I was pretty skeptical when Lauren gave me my first FLEX (I was a lifelong tampon user) but it honestly changed my life.

I promise it won't disappoint and I can't wait to hear what you think!

I was very confused because with a menstral cup that was certainly not the case. So I?m excited to try it out... maybe won?t tell the BF ??
Thanks for reaching out!ÿCaitlinÿ

Hi Caitlin! I?m Merissa, your designated Flexpert.

Why We Were Matched Up / My Period Profile
   
   - I used to use a menstrual cup, which gave me lots-o-extra time but ended up being painful and needy. FLEX gave me my life back without the hurt - I actually can?t feel it at all.ÿ
   - I have a really heavy flow (I fill a super tampon in 1-3 hours) and cramps that felt like a mosh pit in my stomach.

Things You Should Know About Me
   
   - I started my period when I was 10 at a waterpark and was so confused! My mom wasn?t there and my dad got to handle it (like a champ, might I add).
   - I?m an avid runner and love being outside - movement is everything.
   - I grew up in a super small town. It has a population of just over 3,000, most of which are my family.



My First Time Trying FLEX

I tried FLEX on my heaviest day and found what looked like a war-zone in my chonies. Yes, leaks can happen while you're getting used to FLEX. But I?m now enjoying the most comfortable, leak-free period of my life! <3

"ÿzoriI get really awful and intense periods myself, it sucks and I have PCOS and my period is a bitch
I am getting married in a few months and I am wanting to learn a lot about marriage and relationships and all that stuff so I guess doing my research. I love the enneagram and listen to a lot of podcasts about the enneagram (its a personality, and personal dynamics test). My favorites are ( the road back to you, and currently listening to one called the path between us) I also love a podcast called the Liturgists and randomly will listen to crime/tedtalks/funny things and really depends on the day. 

My go to shows ( rewatch like a million times and still go back to them are friends, the office and parks and rec. I am currently on friends ( Again, had a crisis when I found out it was leaving Netflix and started watching it again) My last binge was a random pick from Hulu that ended up being millionaire matchmaker. (its ccringey yet I could not look away and it was so entertaining to watch)ÿ 

I don't know if I believe in astrology but I do read my horoscope randomly and I am a Pisces. ( I am also an 
INFP IN MYERS brigss and a 9 In the eneagram (personality test junkie)
I am intimidated and excited to use my flex, I have never tried anything like it but I have become sexually active and period sex is a whole thing(messy, complicated.. mm yeah).. well this is basically what got me sold.ÿ 
my biggest fear is being able to get it out...or it getting stuck up there, almost got the one with the handle thingy but felt the original would be better for period sex, would the thingy get in the way?( I Have struggles even with tampons getting them all the way in, now that im sexually active maybe it will be easier, still learning to get comfortable with my body and stuff and def not used to it.but we will see how this goes.
is bill nye single? i dont know, I respect it, he is smart and seems like gentleman, no judgement here. 

hope you are a real person and not a computer or i will feel dumb for actually typing this out :P

Hi Zoe,

I?m Zori, your designated Flexpert!

Things You Should Know About Me
   
   - There's nothing I love more than parmesan cheese.
   - I got my first period when I was 11. I thought I was prepared for it until it actually happened?I think I cried for about 2 whole hours; the hormones combined with the idea I'd have to deal with bloodÿcoming out of an area that was extremely confusing to me at the time for basically the rest of my life freaked me out. Can you tell I was a dramatic kid?ÿ
   - I have a really heavy flow and pretty gnarly cramps. Most months it feels like my vagina/uterus betrayed me, but I power through it because I'm a badass and so are you.
   - My first crush ever was Bill Nye the Science Guy. (Still going strong btw... it's weird, I know, stop judging meÿplease.)

Things I'd love to know about you:
   
   - What's your go-to tv show or podcast?
   - What's your sign?
   - Do you know whether or not Bill Nye is single?



My First Time Trying FLEX

It was pretty easy, I was scared, but quickly realized that my biggest issue was that I was overthinking it. Once I relaxed and tried it a couple time, I got it to stay in the right spot. Now, I use my FLEX discs on my lighter days, and my Flex Cup on the heavier ones.

Using discs and the cup has completely changed my definition of what TMI means; I used to be very shy, and self-conscious about my body/period. But now, I will literally have a conversation about my vagina just as casually as I'd talk about my foot or arm. I've never felt more empowered to be myself.ÿ

Let me know if you have any questions about using your disc; I've heard it all! Or if you just want to say hello, that's okay too!

Subject: not happy with flex

I was looking forward to using flex.  But I have not been happy with the flex cup.  It was very uncomfortable, and I could not get it to fit properly.  I am used to a cup and have not had any issues.  I was looking to use something I didn't have to clean.  But flex was so messy to remove I would rather use my cup over this flex.  I wound be using the flex again.

Subject: What to do with those extra 13 weeks/year


Hi Tara,

Do you know what was weirder than getting blood on my hands after switching from tampons? It was getting used to period weeks without intense cramping, diarrhea, and having to call in sick from work.

And our customers feel the same way. They, too, have been able to take back valuable time in their life to do the things they love, even when they?re on their period.

""FLEX is worth every penny! I can go to the gym, do household chores, go in the pool, have sex with my Fiance...yes ladies...I'm not joking. I will never go back."" - Brittany



""Now I can feel secure knowing that I can horseback ride, snowboard, mountain bike, and have sex without any leakage."" - Bonnie



""I basically was sleep deprived before FLEX. Dure to a heavy flow and constant fear of, or actual leaks, in the middle of the night, I was miserable. FLEX has given me the freedom to dinally have a full, non interrupted sleep. In general, don't have to worry about wearing ""period panties"" in case of leaks, scaling back my WOD at Crossfit for fear of leaks, or anything related to the stress of leaks. I'm so relieved and gratefu."" - Tracy



What will you do with all of that time back?

Erika

Hi there,

The full name on my FLEX account is Taylor Heslop and the e-mail address associated with the account is theslop@kumc.edu. I would no longer like to be billed and shipped FLEX automatically, so please cancel this account for me.

I would greatly appreciate to not receive or be billed for the upcoming box, because I only get a period once every three months and have not even used my first box yet. I cannot afford the second box that you were anticipating sending me because my bank account will overdraft. I highly do not wish to receive or be billed for any further boxes. Please do not send the box that I received an email about today on 10/21/2019. Thank you in advance.

HiÿSheri,

I?m Zori, your designated FLEXpert!
Things you should know about me:   
   - There's nothing I love more than parmesan cheese.
   - I got my first period when I was 11. I thought I was prepared for it until it actually happened?I think I cried for about 2 whole hours; the hormones combined with the idea I'd have to deal with blood coming out of an area that was extremely confusing to me at the time for basically the rest of my life freaked me out. Can you tell I was a dramatic kid?
   - I have a really heavy flow and pretty gnarly cramps. Most months it feels like my vagina/uterus betrayed me, but I power through it because I'm a badass and so are you.
   - My first crush ever was Bill Nye the Science Guy. (Still going strong btw... it's weird, I know, stop judging me please.)
Things I'd love to know about you   
   - What's your go-to tv show or podcast?
   - What's your sign?
   - Do you know whether or not Bill Nye is single?

My First Time Trying FLEX

It was pretty easy, I was scared, but quickly realized that my biggest issue was that I was overthinking it. Once I relaxed and tried it a couple time, I got it to stay in the right spot. Now, I use my FLEX discs on my lighter days, and my Flex Cup on the heavier ones.

Using discs and the cup has completely changed my definition of what TMI means; I used to be very shy, and self-conscious about my body/period. But now, I will literally have a conversation about my vagina just as casually as I'd talk about my foot or arm. I've never felt more empowered to be myself.

Let me know if you have any questions about using your disc; I've heard it all! Or if you just want to say hello, that's okay too! If you're not comfortable with reaching out to me, we have tons of helpful articles available in our FAQ. Here's a handy link if you're looking for more information about insertion and removal. I hope you end up lovin' your discs!

Zori

Hello,

I tried the flex fit disc for the first time today and was loving it until removal time. I am unable to get it out. I can?t even reach the plastic rim to hook it with my finger and remove it. Short of having to go to the ER to get it out, what else can I do? I?ve been attempting to remove this for almost an hour. I?ve tried all the methods you?ve posted online (squatting, bearing down to try and push it down, putting one foot up) and nothing. I feel like I am pushing it in further and further. I called your 800# but it appears you all are only available on weekdays. 

If someone gets this email, please respond back and walk me through how to get this out. I am trying to avoid an ER visit today!

Hi,
I have a full 7 day period. Whether I'm spotting or bleeding, I need protection for 7 days and you only offer up to 12 discs a month. I need two more discs each month but there isn't a plan to fit that. How do I get the amount that I need?

Thank you!

Let's look back on how far you've come and what lies in store for you. Hint: It's the most comfortable period of your life.

The Emotional Rollercoaster That Is Trying a Menstrual Disc for The First Time

 

SCROLL AWAY

? You saw an ad for the first time.

? What the? Wait. WHAT? How?!

? Learning that tampons were invented by a man in the 1930s.

? ...and then all the sudden you're woke and order the trial.

? FLEX arrives and you see how big it is.

? But you think f*** it, LET'S DO THIS.

? When you open it for the first time and it flies out of the package.

? You finally wrangle one and put it in.

? But you're too nervous to let it go because you think it's going to be lost forever.

? And then you finally do and you can't feel it at all.

? Then you realize you're not supposed to feel it and start to think F*** TAMPONS.

? You pee for the first time with a menstrual disc in and there's blood in the toilet bowl.

? And you're like oh my god it's leaking.

? But you realize that's normal, too, and go about your day.

? You completely forget you're even on your period.

? Even your cramps are gone!

? You remove it for the first time thinking...

? But remember the shower tip and it's a breeze.

? You throw away all your tampons.

? And live happily ever after with a new outlook on life: I can conquer anything.

The most comfortable period of your life has begun.

To: hello@40flexfits.com <hello@40flexfits.com>


Hi! I just purchased my first cup ever, the flex cup! I wore it last night while sleeping and dumped & washed this morning. I am amazed at how this product works!! I didn?t insert it after cleaning it because I have read over and over that it can only be worn for 12 hours a day. I?m just confused by this- do I purchase another cup to switch off with ( I feel like that still defeats the 12 hour rule purpose- esp. if same product)? Do I have to choose which part of the day I want to use the cup? Are the discs and cups suppose to be used interchangeably (I?m not as comfortable trying the discs)? I want to wear my cup around the clock (dumping & cleaning of course throughout the 24 hours). Help! 
Thank you for your time.
Holly

Subject: Go with your flow
To: <lisasketchum@gmail.com>


Hey ,

Let's get straight to it. What's it like having a heavy flow?

On average, we change our pads or tampons 5+ times a day, and sometimes still leak. On our heaviest days, we sometimes need to change our product every hour, which can be super disruptive to our day.

It's about time we take control of our periods. FLEX discs can hold up to 3 super tampons' worth of fluid. Even with the heaviest flow, a disc can last a full 12 hours.

And on top of that, leaking is a thing of the past. The ComfortSeal? design forms to the shape of our bodies to prevent leaks during sleep, exercise, and even sex. Crazy, right?!

Try FLEX now to experience the difference yourself for only $15 + free shipping (http://trk.klclick1.com/wf/click?upn=gE02jo8QEQs-2FEOLihAE5V53Bckb9X6T9gnyvtGZLgYPQ8ydCbzfnMWgcOWFW3OEia7wxEcmJ9Qr0ojZEcgU15qNjc9Ivvg6YoQfvQrDv1HXTS6ONGsn8B4cX-2FSpL6XCzGGbzhfve3Aj0UOuUhnV3uP-2BFt2aZ-2BTH2M9qmnu9Q7msoDAKeCjRWLB8RH50ynTzMpz7XA6SnWiqw8BdDXxeU0MREzaYHTmKX5AJJYaX8MIUHDFp-2FmqAlX3p-2Fkz-2FX1Ml-2F0ZOgxV7nogspJAg8jHJmfdse8uJiO0H4haVD-2F7EHNXS3LqGJbvxLkuB1D02n6JScy7x4hSQNiD-2Fb6KIMBf2sFw-3D-3D_FEHV4s0Xm-2Bngt82FEf3-2B88Y3hqrrEbVloPIa0w-2BrXdMsCZ-2F0NCJLSxSDViE-2F6GdvRv0KYa6LjLkinQrNCCKoKZoxW-2BceUfSVJkKjLmqIVnK21q6pjwFIfZx9fk-2Bm7nhY0-2BYE2g2MpPM1C8hDXIOCqRrW26MCZlNe4ioRdKRuoKZeVNcPYJjyFnFFowjNVbyYeDIn0GJjzV4SM2ieEhUsmRJYzPLu1Re-2BXBxWNMX2GMAkQvumC-2FuaR3fHIPNiOVFRA45P3CseloA8-2FeeFhBTBcwoFzIFtYw7AUK6kcAKnKsp5F8oPQYd6NzWQgPAKt1R1ZLway9mlw7d878gmJb4a9LBAguy1Geua4EcvJ-2F6qOS5e-2FogggKBKTCWoqWwMcc8GNzoX6gF1YDast-2Ff9J2unIg-3D-3D) .

You told us removing and disposing of FLEX can be a little messy...

We sent you a free trial pack of removal pouches in your most recent order to help out.

We're Listening
We believe that building a better period starts with listening to what people with periods have to say?your experience is important to us!

Here's how to use them:

With clean hands, slip the pouch on your hand like a glove.

Remove the disc as normal.
** Tip: If you can't reach the rim of your disc, place your index finger in the corner of the bag **

As you remove the disc, use your other hand to pull the open flap of the pouch over the disc, securing the disc and menses inside.

Use the adhesive strip to seal the pouch shut.

Toss!

We're committed to giving you the best period experience possible.

Give it a shot, and tell us what you think!

HI,

My name is Vivica Clemons and I just started an account with you all. Today is actually my first day using the flex and so far I love it.  I was wondering though, why I could not successfully change my shipping address.  I am going to move back into my college dorm soon and I wanted my flex shipment to go to my P.O. Box.   Once I changed it in my account it said that there was an error with my last name on the billing address side, but I fixed it.  Yet, the error kept popping up. If you all could go in and fix it for me that would be great.  My p.o. box is 3105, in Buies Creek, NC, 27546.  But. the billing address can stay the same.

The Trial page doesnt let me proceed. Maybe it assumes from my IP address that I will have an physical address in Panama...

Hi Grils!!

I found your product in the internet by complete  coincidence ;)
I've read all articles posted on your website and the only thing which is currently on my mind is.. i need to try!!
But what is the problem?
I havn't found information about shipping to Poland (central-east Europe)
And my questions is if you will send flex-tampons to me? Of course I'll pay for the product before you'll send IT to me, just you to be sure that you won't lose your money.

If you OK with that please send me your bank account and summarized order value.

Thank you Grils!!! And take care of you!

 ÿHello there, I purchased the Flex cup in Full fit at my local CVS as I was instructed that was the size I needed after having children. I purchased at the store because I was leaving for a trip to Greece the next day and couldn't wait for shipping. However, it is too large and it is very uncomfortable to insert, wear and remove. I have had other cups in the past that were much smaller in diameter and length that worked just fine.ÿ
What steps do I need to follow in order to swap out the Full fit for the Slim fit?

Thanks in advance for your assistance.

You signed up to try FLEX for mess-free period sex a while ago and I noticed you haven't ordered a box to try yet. I wanted to sweeten the deal by throwing in a FREE copy of our body-positive magazine, The Fixx, with the first 100 orders placed today.

I have a question. How do you know whether or not the cup is full? Does it feel full similar to what a tampon would feel like when full?

Hi Lauren,

I'm Zori, your designated FLEXpert!

Things you should know about me:

  1.  There's nothing I love more than parmesan cheese.
  2.  I got my first period when I was 11. I thought I was prepared for it until it actually happened-I think I cried for about 2 whole hours; the hormones combined with the idea I'd have to deal with blood coming out of an area that was extremely confusing to me at the time for basically the rest of my life freaked me out. Can you tell I was a dramatic kid?
  3.  I have a really heavy flow and pretty gnarly cramps. Most months it feels like my vagina/uterus betrayed me, but I power through it because I'm a badass and so are you.
  4.  My first crush ever was Bill Nye the Science Guy. (Still going strong btw... it's weird, I know, stop judging me please.)

Things I'd love to know about you

  1.  What's your go-to tv show or podcast?
  2.  What's your sign?
  3.  Do you know whether or not Bill Nye is single?

My First Time Trying FLEX

It was pretty easy, I was scared, but quickly realized that my biggest issue was that I was overthinking it. Once I relaxed and tried it a couple time, I got it to stay in the right spot. Now, I use my FLEX discs on my lighter days, and my Flex Cup on the heavier ones.

Using discs and the cup has completely changed my definition of what TMI means; I used to be very shy, and self-conscious about my body/period. But now, I will literally have a conversation about my vagina just as casually as I'd talk about my foot or arm. I've never felt more empowered to be myself.

Let me know if you have any questions about using your disc; I've heard it all! Or if you just want to say hello, that's okay too! If you're not comfortable with reaching out to me, we have tons of helpful articles available in our FAQ. Here's a handy link<https://trk.klclick2.com/ls/click?upn=rrhvyJmnIAFv7avyRI6elE2ehM-2BcdQCawdQ6SpkT1YYGiHJ1DFPgIFDnYTFArAyRIXxJ60u0ABY9rAiqZLdsE5rkEXa3lfTwedIRUgK3Y-2Bhfx7wUWmZixYG4kzjfrKjwepraMwuOxL46So7qdE4nGLBwzHMfZFBgpuJ2O8Hc6S0yhGE2WruAz7AFHR8oRjM9ha7sDUpeyFcqRtmmldGgRiJsBxVTs3gCZJMCkCmWInRqOa6cdJeNnqbrJ5QInV6dXwSWUj3pxPqkObaCs5jQxmMisqKaVjBclkgH5KclEeSoIyQzhu6cKFJrq0myWnA4sLpxhkIYKAuAutnP2MUIvu-2B0ThIoj7n2Q9yP6x4BGCn-2Bbx4rVoMkwez2kUQTVaSb3jdaS8Wwe-2B2iq1k07W8REvswENtXBfAzI9-2BilNlpsX46bjej25eaZ-2B-2B018vcT1uUW9zkKIzhlFZPTiz8gU4nLjKQ0pnLCpxp1NboAWo7iPk-3DOWqI_tbHWviSGNYDjAQj9lsZI0KLKj9FVXxoUisjfit-2F4s13p0bWjw9OS0mE5GCrfceMyTpgIEiGeXeeIPzeub-2B-2FBTVv8j5XulMGVykTojAAtuqZ7XmiEvrmvt-2Fhrfo7NX7-2BQRKtZz69rVZ4T5cprQfZYU5t5X6NPjoXii-2Bs54KPkX5z1dAiMdFyEkNHbHl2dXGa8f2B1umtyDjYWKIiALHsAdS-2BcYhClJcsamSLcQrgNGPszDw9L1stYclfIFgSafihm-2BPk4TPvzvssHu-2FMuR9A-2BYcLCUdq5Ja4Jkl0x2nbjp7DYp37oEOUAKp7IegJW4MT3FTIPjokqWJJQCZAr6g2yjrMY2SXqAoXprVkeUUbcUqpu7wGflztluG4hY54-2Fbp5a> if you're looking for more information about insertion and removal.

".. I am really unhappy with the Flexcup, for me. It?s not my first time using a menstrual cup but I was due for a new one and wanted to try flex. I love the pull ring concept, but the cup itself is just not working for me; I?ve gone through two period cycles and it is so difficult to get it to pop open once inserted. I have NEVER experienced that with other brands. In addition, the material seems to get very rubbery and I find I often have to lubricate the area for more comfortable insertion. 

I am not sure if a refund is possible but regardless, customer feedback is always important.

This is a bit much for a cancellation. Why is there not an easy way to
cancel a subscription on the website?! Why does one have to sign up
for a subscription to try the product? Also, the prices are
exorbitant. Annually, a person will spend just as much, if not more on
these discs than disposable pads and tampons.

Speaking of pads and tampons this product equally wasteful and as bad
for the environment. Plus, the claim that menstrual discs aren't
associated with or haven't caused anyone to have toxic shock syndrome
is a bit premature and it's interesting that the website at one point
mentioned that menstrual cups have been associated with tss but now
Flex is soon to be selling a cup. What gives?",79903

Here?s how it works: Moving forward, we?ll send you a 3-month supply of FLEX (24 discs for $29) instead of a one-month supply (8 discs for $15). That?s the same number of discs for just $9.65 per month (and a $16 savings per order!)

By shipping every three months, we can down waste over 60% and save on shipping costs, which means we can pass those savings along to you. As always, shipping is included and you can skip, adjust your frequency, or cancel anytime.

Just reply ?Y? for yes to this email, and I?ll apply the $16 discount for all of your upcoming orders.

Cheers, 
Merissa",47753

Hi there! I just cancelled my subscription but I wanted to know if there was a way to cancel the box that is supposed to ship in the next day or so?? I didn't realize that after the first $15 box I was automatically subscribed to receiving it again. I really liked Flex and have recommended it to other friends, but I have not recently been getting my menstrual cycle and so for now I don't need to be purchasing any more discs from Flex. 

Anyway, like I asked before, is there a way to cancel the shipment set to go out in the next couple days & refund the amount? Please? 

Thank you and I hope you are having a wonderful week so far!

Hello Erika,

   Thank you for reaching out. I paused my membership because I don't use a full box during my cycle, so I have more than enough right now. So for now, please leave my membership paused, thank you!

Hi Noela,

How?s it going?

I saw you paused your FLEX membership recently and just wanted to reach out to see if I can help in any way.

We?ve found that only 33% of people use FLEX successfully within their first cycle. The other 66% of us need up to 2 full boxes.

I?d love to get another box out to you to try and help you through it this time. Can I unpause your membership? Just reply with Y for yes or N for no and I?ll take care of the rest.

We can do this!

Cheers,
Erika

  Softdisc is made out of a medical-grade polymer and has been tested for biocompatibility. It?s hypoallergenic, BPA & phthalate-free, silicone-free and made without natural rubber latex. Unlike a tampon, FLEX does not disrupt the pH of your vagina, which can lead to yeast infections or bacterial infections.

Hello again Hello,

As you are aware I'm really trying my best to build a relationship with you, and haul some freight for The Flex Company. Hello while I absolutely love my job-I know I will love it a million times more if I can get a single load hauled for you!

I know Translogistics has the best customers in the world, and I would love for you to be one of them!

Can I get you back a competitive rate on any TLs going on? If it is in-line with the market can you please award me the chance to showcase the TLI customer experience. If you are not thrilled, then no need to route again!!

Best regards,

Hello as you are aware I am really looking for a shot at handling a load for The Flex Company.

90% of TL carriers have 6 or less trucks, and the top 10 carriers have 10% of market share - we have thousands and thousands of niche carriers that can meet your needs, and these are lanes TLI will absolutely perform incredible for you on, so please give me a shot at a quote!!

Another document based off client request was an educational one regarding claims - please let me knowHello if this is valuable to you or perhaps a client who is not signing the DR's properly.

Hello,
Clients of mine were requesting this, as they occasionally were wondering what the industry norms were for paying accessorials on their LTL & TL freight.

Hello ,

The Flex Company has been on my radar, and I am just looking for a shot at a quote! Please give me a chance.

But don?t just quote TLI simply because we often come back with the best rates, please route your freight through me because TLI is the best logistics management company out here & I will personally make sure you are totally satisfied with your experience routing freight through us.

"[cid:73EACAA0-F93A-4736-B87D-D2EBCD4F822E-L0-001]Hello I?ve attached a picture with the order number that I would like to have hopefully canceled. I was totally unaware that I was signing up for a subscription and I do not need this product. I was just trying it out and unfortunately this product is not a good fit for me. Is there any way I could either cancel this order or return it if it?s too late to cancel for a full refund?

Please and thanks,

I just received this email stating that I have a second shipment on the way. When i purchased the first time I thought it was a trial pack. I?m pretty positive it was not a monthly subscription as I have not had good experiences with those in the past and am very careful to not sign up for those now.
I also do not need a second shipment yet as I was only able to use one disc during my last cycle and I leaked terribly. I would like one more cycle to try them before I?m charged and receiving another shipment.

Please let me know if any adjustments can be made.

Thank you, Dwan Simpson

Dear Flex,

Imagine a generation of children who love learning. Children who are
self-possessed and confident in their abilities, socially and
environmentally responsible, inclusive and compassionate, and bounding with
creativity and problem-solving skills. That is the motivation behind
everything we do at Golden Bridges School -- San Francisco's first and only
urban farm school.

We believe everyone deserves access to the education we offer and no family
is turned away due to financial circumstances. This is why we count on the
generosity of our community and those who believe that a more holistic,
empowering education is not only possible, but necessary for our times. Our
annual Plant A Party fundraiser, March 14th, 2020 at the Italian-American
Social Club, provides our community and supporters the opportunity to
contribute to a bold vision for a more just and compassionate future, one
amazing child at a time.

Plant A Party is an inspiring evening of great food, wine, entertainment,
and friends. Plant A Party provides vital funds for school operations,
teacher salaries, and school supplies, and helps to bridge the gap for our
essential tuition assistance. For the past six years, hundreds of parents
and local residents have attended and bid on silent, online, and live
auction items to support our cause. Last year, we had over 130 people in
attendance and raised over $100,000. This year we must exceed that amount
in order to grow and cover the expenses of being a school in San Francisco.

Please consider donating a Flex Cup Discovery Kit to Plant A Party. In
appreciation of your contribution, Flex will receive valuable exposure in
our program, online, and at the auction. It?s a great opportunity to reach
an attentive and appreciative audience of potential and current customers!

If you have questions regarding the event or our school, please contact:
auction@goldenbridgesschool.org. Your contribution is tax-deductible to the
extent provided by law. The Golden Bridges School tax ID # is: 46-1368900.
You can simply respond to this email if your donation can be attached, or
send your donation to: Golden Bridges School, ? Plant A Party, 65 Ocean
Avenue, San Francisco, CA 94112.

Thank you so much for your consideration.



Sincerely,

Allyson Ritger

Dear Flex fit,
      My name is Katey Vancise. I'm writing to u because I had bought my 1st cup a couple months back and absolutely loved it but then it did this. I then purchased a diva cup ( it's less expensive and I am recently divorced single mom of 3 boys) but I don't like the diva cup no where near as much as I like this one. I was wondering if there is anything ya'll could do to help me out. I've shared posts on your product on Facebook and tell all my lady friends how amazing it is.
              Thank you

Subject: Tips + Tricks from your Flexpert


Hello Kristin,

I'm Helena, your designated Flexpert.

Trying FLEX can seem daunting, even a little intimidating at first. But I wanted to let you know that you're not alone. I've been there and use FLEX myself so please consider me a guide through the trial process.

A little about me...

  1.  My friends and family live for my character impressions - from Cher, to Julia Childs, to Lois from Family Guy.
  2.  I'm addicted to true crime everything - books, podcasts, shows. Not on my watch! ;)
  3.  On a Friday night, you'll find me having a glass of wine, binging one of my fave shows, and snuggling with my sweet pup, Willie.

My Period Profile

  1.  I started my period on my 14th birthday at a bowling alley party.
  2.  I've tried pads, tampons, period panties, cups. I've done it all!
  3.  I have a medium flow and my cycle is predictable - unlike my love life.

My First Time Trying Flex

* Thanks for your reply... here are my responses to your questions:
* Are you trying both our Full Fit and Slim Fit Cup? I tried the full fit because i am 36 years old and have had 3 babies, so your website suggested the full fit.
* What folds have you tried? I have tried the U, the tulip, the 7, and the roll. Each one inserts fine but does not stay in.
* Have you tried a different position for insertion? Yes, sitting, standing with one leg up, squatting, leaning... any way i can think of and relax in :)
* How high is it inserted? (How far past the vaginal opening is the bottom of the cup? Is the pull tab fully internal or partially external?) I insert the cup pretty far, a finger length, so the pull tab is half an inch or an inch from the base of my canal
* Is it comfortable to wear? No, I can feel it
* How quickly after you insert it does it slide down? If I bear down (Like pushing in childbirth) I can push it out right away. If I tighten my pelvic floor i can keep it in for a few minutes but it always finds its way out.
* Is there anything else about your experience that you'd like to share? I am so frustrated! Everyone I talk to LOVES their cup and i want to make it work so badly!!

 

Thanks so Much for your help.

Hey there,

My name is Emily and I am part of the team at CoreSEO.

We've done some research on your Shopify store, and it seems that
it does not rank high on Google for a lot of keywords related to
your niche.
SEO is the main ingredient to any successful shop. Its free,
highly targetted and it never stops coming in.
A weakness will allow smart competitors to capitalize on this,
and you will be left behind.

A good layout and nice products alone won't bring in customers.
You need eyeballs looking over your site.
If you're not ranking higher, those eyeballs will never get to
see your webshop and you'll miss out big time on a constant
stream of customers.

On June 3rd 2019, Google made a massive change to it's algorithm
called the Core update.
Right now is the best time to get back into search marketing
since they have opened up the markets to smaller websites in a
single sweep.

Unfortunately, it requires a lot of research and hard work in
order to succeed.
We wanted to simplify that for business owners - that's why we
built CoreSEO.

CoreSEO has been crafted after months of research by experienced
SEO experts, making sure you do what makes Google love you.

Right now, we have a promotion going on with a 79% discount,
making it just ten dollar!
Try it here: http://bit.ly/2NEPoZq

Emily

Hey,

Sarah here from Beeketing.

We are happy to announce a partnership with EngagerMate

Many (online) businesses are leaving money on the table by not
engaging on Instagram more often, while it has over 1+ billion
active users and an engagement rate 52 times higher than on
Facebook.
It's no wonder why over 90% of the top brands are on Instagram.

In order to be relevant you need to be interactive with your
followers and customers.
How does a DM to new followers with a warm welcome or a coupon
sound like?
Awesome, right? Doing this all manually is draining way too much
of your valuable time while running a full-time business.

During the last couple of years we helped A LOT of Shopify stores
reach new customers, resulting in more sales. How would you feel
to be the next success story?

Did I pique your interest?
Try it here: http://bit.ly/2NldIzl

After this, you only need to sit back and relax while the
software is doing it's best in driving the traffic to your shop.

If you don't like it for whatever reason in the first 14 days, we
will offer a full refund. No questions asked :-)

Kind Regards,

Sarah @ Beeketing",134270

I?m a first time user of a mensuration cup & did plenty of research prior to buying one. I personally dont know a single woman who uses one, but I have ALWAYS been curious to see how it?d work for me. During this pandemic, my perspective on waste & excess has really changed for the better in that my family and I are ultra aware of waste in all forms; packaging, food, etc. With that said, I finally felt ready to minimize my usage of tampons & pads and go for the cup. After all the reviews and videos had been watched, I pulled the trigger and ordered a flex cup over any other brand because I liked the secure looking pull/loop feature.
I should also add that I?ve given birth twice vaginally & pushed out twins & a singleton - so I assumed I was pretty comfortable w/my body and knew myself well. WRONG. This cup has allowed me to really see how my body is working during a cycle & what looks ?normal? vs what?s soaked into a tampon. It?s been really mind blowing and life changing when I say that this product has made me get to know my body differently.
 
So, now to inserting: I tried inserting the cup in the middle of my cycle & couldn?t do it so I put it aside for the next day when I had more patience. The next day I got it in successfully and securely and was so shocked in myself. I was just really excited and actually felt Ike I had gotten a new toy I was playing with. Potential bad analogy, but hopefully you get the idea. 
Fast fwd 10hrs and I take it out not only to find the cup worked successfully BUT I had also not spilled a drop. I washed it, inserted it again & went on my night. I mean, I am just so absolutely thrilled to use this cup and have already raved to my closest friends and family about it. I need them to also have a period that isn?t as dreadful or time consuming. 
Thank you to Lauren S Wang for creating a product that is not only EXTREMELY useful, but also very nice to look at, easy to use and convenient to store. Empowering women with their periods is something tremendously positive and inspiring.

"*Hello The Flex Company,My name is Angela and I am the Co Founder & Finance
Director of Period at UC Davis. We are a chapter of the international
organization called Period, whose mission is to provide free and accessible
menstrual products to women in need and educating and having an open
conversation about periods and getting rid of the stigma. It was actually
recently when our Program Director, Nicole, discovered your company and was
really intrigued by your product and brought it up in our meeting. We
realized just how many students here are interested in your company. We are
a newly created student organization hoping to make a splash and give back
to our community. I am reaching out to you today because we, at Period at
UC Davis, would love to work with you because of your company?s innovation
in a product that creates a better period experience for women and allow
them freedom to do everyday activities that they enjoy. Working with us
would be an amazing opportunity to market your name on the UC Davis campus
and help us make a difference to help others. We are currently hoping to
create period packs filled with menstrual products to distribute to

*Dear Colleague,*

*The Red Herring is pleased to make contact with The Flex Company to ask
for your initial submission to the 2019 Red Herring Top 100 North America
competition. We will consider the suitability for entering into the next
stage after we complete the first layer of due diligence on **The Flex
Company**.*

*Red Herring, since its beginnings and increasingly since 2003, has
advocated scouting the most creative ideas and the most audacious
entrepreneurs regardless of their location. It is why we search far and
broad. The payoff has often exceeded our expectation. Early on Red Herring
scouted Spotify, blablacar, Delivery Hero, Shazam, Supercell, Skype, Yandex
and most European success stories as well as Facebook, Google, Yahoo,
Skype, eBay, Salesforce, Baidu, Rakuten, Renren, and Zynga. Needless to
say, we are continuing our effort and constantly reinforcing our footprint.*

*To be in the Red Herring Top 100 is a landmark event as it showcases the
most promising technology or innovative companies in North America for that
year. We welcome an initial study of The Flex Company with details to be
filled out by your company in order to start our official review by the Red
Herring. Based on a sample of the information below that we have researched
on your company, we would like to hear more about your company through the
online submission link further below. Note that we are not publishing any
of the information below nor do we publish any of the data collected on the
confidential submission form.*

*Your rating from Red Herring's point of view for 2019? Well you can not
win the 2019 Red Herring Top 100 Award unless you make the first step with
an online submission even if you have won in earlier years. Even if you
have won an award in prior years, every year is a new year to win again to
strengthen your standings in the technology ecosystem.*

*The online submission must be completed before March 14th, 2019 and the
sooner completed the sooner we can begin our due diligence and confirm your
potential spot as a Finalist.  Include Special Code (JGB2019) at the
beginning of the submission form or else your submission will not receive
priority consideration.*

*The next step will be a short 15 min phone interview and the chosen
Finalists will be given the opportunity to present at the Red Herring 100
North America in May of 2019 in Los Angeles. In addition, the winners will
be invited to the Red Herring 100 Global held later in the year.*

Today is a big
day for CartHook!

We are hoping you would
be interested
in helping us announce our most significant update ever by
checking out our Product Hunt listing that launched today and
sharing any feedback or opportunities you want to see from us in
the future.

( http://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiOTg4MDQxNiIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiMzc2NTM2NDA3NyIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByb2R1Y3RodW50LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9jYXJ0aG9vay1lZGl0b3ItMi0wP19fcz1heGdjeGhnYXN2dm5kZHoycHZqMyJ9 )

Why we are launching on Product Hunt

Since we got started in 2016, we have focused on offering the
best checkout experience to Shopify store owners. This meant
building all the features one would need to create the perfect
checkout page and upsell offers. And after 18 months and hundreds
of requests, we are finally ready to announce the new CartHook
Editor 2.0!

We have developed a whole new platform that allows our customers
to build the exact checkout experience and eCommerce funnel they
want with just a few clicks. Our goal was to design a robust
editor that was simple to use and allowed for each customer to
save their work and even share with others.

To thank you all and
celebrate our launch, we want to offer
$100 off the first month ( http://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiOTg4MDQxNiIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiMzc2NTM2NDA3NyIsInVybCI6Imh0dHA6Ly9jb250ZW50LmNhcnRob29rLmNvbS9lZGl0b3I_cmVmPXByb2R1Y3RodW50XHUwMDI2X19zPWF4Z2N4aGdhc3Z2bmRkejJwdmozIn0 ) if you

Hi BRENDA HOWARD,
I realized that I forgot to tell you in my last email about the other benefits of FLEX, besides mess-free period sex.ÿ
Did you know that FLEX: ÿ

was originally designed to replace tampons, pads and menstrual cups
*
can be worn up to 12 hours
*
holds 3 super tampons worth of fluid
*
is not linked to TSS
*
helps to relieve cramping

"#162883  Shipped July 23 2018

Because I'm smart, I planned this order so that I would have my Flex for this current period... It's been a few weeks now, you sent me a confirmation that the order had shipped on July 23.  Where is my order?  If it had not shipped yet, was I lied to?  Why?  The package should be here by now.  

And FYI, my period started yesterday and I had to go to the store to buy tampons.  Thanks for that unexpected expense.  I'm hoping (but doubting) you're going to do something to make up for this delay.

Come on, ladies. I've been a customer for over a year.  Don't make me cancel.  This is not okay.  I've sung your praises and handed out Flex to three friends, trying to do a grass-roots promotion for you.  Now I wish I never had - I could really use those discs.  :(

Hello Ladies @Flex!

I'm reaching out with an exciting opportunity!

This Summer we will launch a series of fundraiser screenings in all 10 cities we have chapters in. Bleed On: A fundraiser screening to benefit #HappyPeriod.

See Here Now: #HappyPeriod is a video we produced with Refinery29, highlighting social issues surrounding menstruation. I have an vision to have a partner/sponsors for the event to host us, screen this piece and raise funds.

As of now we're set to go live on May 28th, Menstrual Hygiene Day, with an event in Chicago.
June 9th is set for Oakland/SF, and June 25th will be Atlanta. We're filling in other stops quickly!

If you are interest in becoming a partner or sponsor for Bleed On, feel free to contact me directly. I'm open to your thoughts and feedback.

A deck is attached for your viewing.
Thank you so much for reading this email and the support you've given my org thus far.

Love & Unity,

Chelsea

Hi there,


The full name on my FLEX account is Brianna Sholte and the e-mail address associated with the account is sholtebr@msu.edu. I would no longer like to be billed and shipped FLEX automatically, so please cancel this account for me. I understand that this may take up to 24 hours to complete (excluding weekends).


Thanks!

"<span style=""font-family: sans-serif; font-size: large;"">Hi,</span><div dir=""auto"" style=""font-family: sans-serif; font-size: large;""> So I recently decided to try Flex, as I'd kept seeing ass for it. At first I was hesitant to subscribe, so I purchased one month on its own back near the end of September, and shortly after, I signed up for the 3 month supply. I have since received the three month supply, but I never received the one month supply I'd previously purchased. I did receive the shipping notification, but now about a month later, the link to track it still says ""in transit"" but when I try to further investigate, the dhl website says the tracking information cannot be found. I gave it some time because even the three month order took a couple weeks to arrive. I have the order number if that helps, it's <span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">57689. I was just wondering what might've happened. Thank you. </span></div>",11253

I want to love it, but cannot get it to stop leaking on my heavier days. The cup is not full, and I do check that it opened correctly.  On my lighter days, it?s seems to work just fine. I?ve tried different folds (down the middle and the one that you wrap around).  Anything else that could be wrong? I would love to just be able to use the cup instead of having to constantly switch it out or having to use back up protection.

> Hi Zori-
> 	To answer your questions, Bill Nye isn?t married?he had a fake wedding to a woman who ended up being a really bad piece of his life. It ended in a restraining order! Yikes!?!?!  I am a scorpio true to nature!  My go to TV shows are the following: Law and Order, Law and Order SVU, Ghost Adventures, American Pickers, Tanked, Live PD/PD Cam/ Rescue, Wheel of Fortune to name a few! Will let you know if I have any questions when my Flex arrives!

> Hi Jenny,
> I?m Zori, your designated FLEXpert!
> Things you should know about me:
> There's nothing I love more than parmesan cheese.
> I got my first period when I was 11. I thought I was prepared for it until it actually happened?I think I cried for about 2 whole hours; the hormones combined with the idea I'd have to deal with blood coming out of an area that was extremely confusing to me at the time for basically the rest of my life freaked me out. Can you tell I was a dramatic kid?
> I have a really heavy flow and pretty gnarly cramps. Most months it feels like my vagina/uterus betrayed me, but I power through it because I'm a badass and so are you.
> My first crush ever was Bill Nye the Science Guy. (Still going strong btw... it's weird, I know, stop judging me please.)
> Things I'd love to know about you
> What's your go-to tv show or podcast?
> What's your sign?
> Do you know whether or not Bill Nye is single?
> My First Time Trying FLEX
> It was pretty easy, I was scared, but quickly realized that my biggest issue was that I was overthinking it. Once I relaxed and tried it a couple time, I got it to stay in the right spot. Now, I use my FLEX discs on my lighter days, and my Flex Cup on the heavier ones.
> Using discs and the cup has completely changed my definition of what TMI means; I used to be very shy, and self-conscious about my body/period. But now, I will literally have a conversation about my vagina just as casually as I'd talk about my foot or arm. I've never felt more empowered to be myself.
> Let me know if you have any questions about using your disc; I've heard it all! Or if you just want to say hello, that's okay too! If you're not comfortable with reaching out to me, we have tons of helpful articles available in our FAQ. Here's a handy link if you're looking for more information about insertion and removal. I hope you end up lovin' your discs!

> My blog, Baby Boxin, focuses on everything pertaining to body, life, and baby. Specifically, we have three categories we go off of: product reviews, life discussions, and facts. Currently, I am partnering with a series of companies who specialize in products that reduce pain during menstruation for a large, several month product review. The companies are as follows; NannoCare, Remedi Organics, Foria, Ncap Medical, TummyDrops, and Corganics. I am doing such a large review compilation because I have Dysmenorrhea and Endometriosis, which in itself, causes severe pain/nausea during menstruation,  plus infertility. I will be doing this review in the months leading up to my Endometriosis excision surgery. I heave read about your product and have found that it falls under the category I am currently reviewing. If you are interested in being apart of this review compilation I would love to work with Flex Fit! All that is required is a complementary sample(s) of the product. I do my reviews very thoroughly and only test one product at a time throughout the span of about a month. I hope you find this as a great opportunity, as I do. Looking forward to your response.


*Note: Baby Boxin is currently reviewing their 4th product of the series, they are willing to extend the series to work with Flex Fit! 

*Other credible companies Baby Boxin has partnered with outside of this series: The Honey Pot Co

As you read above, no link was provided. I hope at some point these password resets are fixed on your website. This is the second time this is happening to me with your website. In any case, I would like to purchase the Flex Menstrual Cup and/or change the subscription (for my flow) so I do need access to my account. Thank you.

I am happy with your product. I didn't feel itÿafter it was in place. but did feel it inÿcertain positions.ÿit did allowed me to have sex with my boyfriend with any or a lot of blood. the first night there was no blood, but on my heavy days there was little blood after sex. I think he knocked it out of place. he did tell me after that he could feel it inside of me during intercourse. and that the hard plastic ring would crap against is privates/d*#k. 
I was wondering if your company can make theÿplastic ring thinner and softer. If you guys do, I know that I would be a long term,ÿvery happyÿcustomer.
thank youJillÿ

Hi Kimberly,

Checking in because you?ve been a FLEX subscriber for a while now (yay!) and I want to upgrade your order to save you an additional $4 every month.

By upgrading you'll get a 24 pack of FLEX shipped every 3 months for only $11 per month, charged annually ($135/year). You'll be saving $45/year -- that's 3 months of FLEX for free! As always shipping is free and you can adjust your shipments at anytime.

 

Can I upgrade you to help you save next year? Reply Y for yes or N for no and I?ll take care of the rest.

"A big thank you for creating this product. It is a huge change for me and a great one moving from pads to discs.
I always feared using tampons and cups but somehow your product convinced me to give it a try and i am so glad i did.
It is honestly a breeze using it and i realized my cramps are much less intense than they used to be.
Also, they work great for mess free sex period. i nearly gave up on using it after experiencing discomfort on my first few tries
but my husband believed in your product and the benefits they came with and pushed me to give it another go and i am so glad i did
No more uncomfortable soggy pads and the smell of blood in the air

Thank you once again

Tamara,

The only thing worse than trying a new period product and it not working is ruining your favorite pair of jeans.

Hi there,

Thanks for being such an awesome customer! We wanted to reach out and inform you about a change to your FLEX subscription.

The regular subscription rate for 24 pack of FLEX is $15 a month charged every three months, but we offer a promotion to receive your first order of FLEX for only $15. It looks like you took advantage of that offer, and due to a technical glitch, your subscription was not changed back to the regular rate.ÿ We?re writing to inform you that we just made that change and, moving forward, your subscription will be set to the regular rate and your next order will be priced at $45.

We?d love to offer you a discount on your next order as an apology for the goof! Just reply back to this e-mail to take advantage of that, and we?ll hook you up.

Thanks,

FLEX can take some getting used to (many rad things do!) with its positioning and placement, so please don?t hesitate to give me a heads up and holler if you have any questions or comments.

I?m here to help you with anything.

"A few month's ago, I purchased the full fit cup (with 2 disc samples) from CVS. I've had 3 children and thought it would work given your recommendations. It was too big. I was leaking, a lot, and it would feel like I had to have a bowel movement all the time. So I purchased the slim fit and once I got the positioning down, it has worked great. I was looking to see how I go about getting a refund. Thank you, for your time!",264639
A few months ago I got a sample pack of removal bags. I was wondering if they are going to become an option for subscription or if y'all decided not to use them. I currently use the wrapper the disc comes in to remove and toss. It was much cleaner with the bags though I enjoyed them.,146987
"A few months ago I paused or cancelled the subscription (I can?t remember which). Then I received an email saying you had trouble running my card and I didn?t update the card because I didn?t want the subscription. Then two days ago I received a package in the mail full of flex disk. I don?t want the subscription and I?d love to know what account you charged if there was trouble with my card. I don?t even have my period right now, I don?t need these and I can?t be spending money on them. Please contact me as soon as possible on this matter. Thank you in advance for your help. ",162597
"A few months ago I signed up for a sample box to try it out. I specifically did not want to subscribe until I had more money and actually tried the product out. I just found out that about a week ago i was charged 49 dollars! I am not happy with this and cannot figure out how to cancel it. Please help.

"A few questions/ issues I?m having with my first flex box. 

For the most part, it?s going well. I can?t feel it when it?s in and it?s catching the blood. 
BUT
It doesn?t ?flex? with me, gets dislodged, and I?ve experienced a lot of leaks at inconvenient times. 
When it gets dislodged, I still can?t feel the actual disc, but I can feel the blood leak out around it thus making me need to sprint to the restroom to avoid getting blood all over my clothes as some of the leaks have been more than the panty liner can handle. 
Can you explain what I?m doing wrong? Am I expecting too much? Tampons are annoying but only ever leaked if they got too full. These have been leaking at odd moments, not really just when they might be ?full?. They?ve leaked overnight when putting in a new one before bed. I just had one leak now when I was lounging on the couch. It?s been in 8 hours.
With only 8 in the box, I?ve been trying to make them last 12 because I have a 6 day period and already don?t have enough to last the whole time. 
Thanks for reading, I hope you can help me troubleshoot.

Hi Laurie, nice to meet you! I?m Kat, your designated Flexpert.

Things You Should Know About Me

1. I started my period during the first day of soccer tryouts in 7th grade.
2. I know all of the lines in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets movie.
3. I?ve been to the last 6 Dapper Days at Disneyland.

Why We Were Matched Up / My Period Profile

1. I used to wear tampons like clockwork. Running to the bathroom every 2 hours to change it and it was terrible! I was nervous about trying FLEX because I was worried it would hurt, but I was stunned and pleasantly surprised when I tried and could actually not feel FLEX.
2. I have a heavy-to-medium flow depending on the day of my cycle. I can tell when it?s coming since I?ll start eating all of the chocolate and happy-crying to videos of puppies and kids getting adopted.

My First Time Trying FLEX

I couldn't get insertion right, which was super frustrating! I tried different positions until I found one that worked for me (one leg up on the tub!). Once I got that down, it was smooth sailing! Now my period week is a breeze!

Want to chat about FLEX?  Or maybe just say hey? Ask me anything (nothing is TMI)!

Always here for you when you need me - even in the bathroom! :)

"A few weeks ago I purchased a flex cup via Amazon and tried it for the first time a little over a week ago when I got my period. I got the larger cup as recommended since I have given birth to two children in the past couple of years. After putting it in I felt like I had to pee the entire time and when I would pee while I had the flex cup in I experienced pain while urinating. Also when I pulled the release tab to remove it created a lot of uncomfortable pressure on my cervix, and I have an IUD which made me nervous about accidentally dislodging it. Not sure where I went wrong, I was too scared to use it again for the rest of my period!",304925
"A few weeks ago I submitted an inquiry about the perfect fit gaurantee because I believe the ""full fit"" that I bought is too large for me. I was told I would be followed up by with another team member, I provided my email address, and I haven't heard back. I just wanted to follow up tonight.

"A little nervous about getting the flex out the 1st time. Worried it might get stuck. I have a wedding coming up soon(right on my period week). Which is why I?m trying flex, I can?t run back and forth to the restroom so I like the idea of 12 hours or so fit.

A member of a group I'm in on Facebook (The Uterati) made a post asking about having sex while using the flex disc. I commented letting them know I had to go to the hospital to get the disc removed after having sex while using the product. The comment was removed and I've been asked to contact you and let you know of this to get in touch with a member of the Regulatory Department.,289706

"A third date doesn?t mean sex is implied and I don?t believe this is the message you should portray. 
However the product is a good product. But it isn?t all just about sex. And the flex being where it is won?t stop the cramping and bloating. But it will make everything not messy. 
So good product, but bad message.

Hi Karen,

I?m Zori, your designated FLEXpert!

Things you should know about me:

1. There's nothing I love more than parmesan cheese.
2. I got my first period when I was 11. I thought I was prepared for it until it actually happened?I think I cried for about 2 whole hours; the hormones combined with the idea I'd have to deal with blood coming out of an area that was extremely confusing to me at the time for basically the rest of my life freaked me out. Can you tell I was a dramatic kid?
3. I have a really heavy flow and pretty gnarly cramps. Most months it feels like my vagina/uterus betrayed me, but I power through it because I'm a badass and so are you.
4. My first crush ever was Bill Nye the Science Guy. (Still going strong btw... it's weird, I know, stop judging me please.)

Things I'd love to know about you

1. What's your go-to tv show or podcast?
2. What's your sign?
3. Do you know whether or not Bill Nye is single?

My First Time Trying FLEX

It was pretty easy, I was scared, but quickly realized that my biggest issue was that I was overthinking it. Once I relaxed and tried it a couple time, I got it to stay in the right spot. Now, I use my FLEX discs on my lighter days, and my Flex Cup on the heavier ones.

Using discs and the cup has completely changed my definition of what TMI means; I used to be very shy, and self-conscious about my body/period. But now, I will literally have a conversation about my vagina just as casually as I'd talk about my foot or arm. I've never felt more empowered to be myself.

Let me know if you have any questions about using your disc; I've heard it all! Or if you just want to say hello, that's okay too! If you're not comfortable with reaching out to me, we have tons of helpful articles available in our FAQ. Here's a handy link (https://trk.klclick2.com/ls/click?upn=rrhvyJmnIAFv7avyRI6elE2ehM-2BcdQCawdQ6SpkT1YYGiHJ1DFPgIFDnYTFArAyRIXxJ60u0ABY9rAiqZLdsE5rkEXa3lfTwedIRUgK3Y-2Bhfx7wUWmZixYG4kzjfrKjwepraMwuOxL46So7qdE4nGLBwzHMfZFBgpuJ2O8Hc6S0yhGE2WruAz7AFHR8oRjM9ha7sDUpeyFcqRtmmldGgRiJsBxVTs3gCZJMCkCmWInRqOa6cdJeNnqbrJ5QInV6dXwSWUj3pxPqkObaCs5jQxmMisqKaVjBclkgH5KclEeSoIyQzhu6cKFJrq0myWnA4sLpxhkIYKAuAutnP2MUIvu-2B0ThIoj7n2Q9yP6x4BGCn-2Bbx4rVoMkwez2kUQTVaSbVzJoqoHn9qsLN5fS8yLxF0SmRSrPixhIDuC3D5GbSpQPACsF4dUB1Md229PYawuwu8pb-2FgSJRXVxHvZTC-2BKf6XxWAlpePNJNwPstsSWQVkY7kf1-2BfHXUZmDHkqAY6BonsXpV_Ysb16jy9gQByK4eQibmZRSsfUZP2VvdP2wf7xVJfM3HVrzb6BDZwGCFkYozc-2BeRUYQVdKAgLI26u-2Br2UQ2x-2F2ujp19xrwjNgl14WNniA7c-2BttbuAXP44F9f4zqnLVKcEX-2BgsZmQW7cSbZSQyZhmf3-2FYysHrN1UhyCizWcq7WY8Q74AM7HmizCCjPD5oVg2rLrn07iXD-2Fq41tZiGromH9qgriwtSNfvHX-2BzElE7vX9eBTFnyQRbSw6ldxYcp5WbMpnGWDTOKjb4IBd9-2FWi-2BVz9jg0U1jYTqE49gBYlUqPa9ceF41wWUpoU0zscYayu6HfB1mpvIEQ9ifgoED2gBHo3yvnZ9JBCQrX5uaOF2HLiRFgK0TfXh3HeXY4G8BZMB9a3lYXWLgQMG5rtkSIcLeYwQ-3D-3D) if you're looking for more information about insertion and removal.

Hello Amy,

I'm Helena, your designated Flexpert.

Why We Were Matched Up / My Period Profile

1. I used tampons before switching to FLEX, so I've been in your position and I get what it's like to have to run to the bathroom every 4 hours.
2. I have a medium/average flow and my cycle is predictable unlike my love life.

Things You Should Know About Me

1. I started on my period on my 14th birthday at a bowling alley party.
2. I do a pretty good Cher impersonation.
3. My favorite show is Jane the Virgin.

My First Time Trying Flex

I was really nervous the first time and had to take a few deep breaths, but it was really easy! Now, my first removal was another story. A comical disaster, but lesson learned. Pee before you remove is all I'll say. ;)

Want to chat about FLEX? Or maybe just say hey?

Ask me anything (nothing is TMI) and I'll get back to you shortly. If you're more of a texter, you can also reach me at (310) 773-4242. Can't wait!

Happy to be helping you from the other side of the bathroom,

Helena

About two months ago I purchased a regular sized cup. I took the quiz on which cup to order and have read about insertion and I always have leakage while wearing it. I always have to wear a decent coverage pad while using the cup. When I go to remove the cup there is blood inside the cup so I know it?s in place but it?s not protecting me from leakage. Which I?m disappointed about because of the price I paid for it. I purchased it at a local target store. I?ve read some comments and reviews and now I?m wondering if I should have purchased the larger size? ,309366

"Absolutely loving Flex!  I am 48 and surprised to find something new.  Wish I had found Flex sooner.  I do have difficulty with leaking. I am guessing it is as good as it gets but I want to check with you to be sure. I am sure the disc is correctly inserted. I am putting it behind the pubic bone and I cannot feel it.  I have heavy periods and am very stretched out from delivering babies. When using the highest absorbency of tampons for the first 3 days of each cycle I go thru a tampon every 1-3 hours. Leaks are common so I use a back up panty liner with tampons and sometimes those liners should be bigger!  So I watched your video about leaking while going to the bathroom.  That definitely happens to me except it is not a few drops. It pours out! This is only my second cycle to use the discs.  I am getting better at recognizing when I am starting to leak and need to go to the bathroom so the disc can empty.  Sometimes I use panty liners and sometimes I wear period proof underwear.  This morning when I woke up (after about 9-10 hours of use), I was glad I had period proof panties on.  There was a huge amount of leaking. So do you have any suggestions?  Thank you for your time.

Hi Shaina,

Checking in because you?ve been a FLEX subscriber for a couple months now (yay!) and I want to upgrade your order to save you $5 every month.

By upgrading you'll get a 24 pack of FLEX shipped every 3 months for only $45 ($15 per month) instead of having an 8 pack shipped every month for $20. As always shipping is free and you can skip, adjust your frequency, or cancel at anytime.

Can I upgrade you to help you save next month? Reply Y for yes or N for no and I?ll take care of the rest.

Hi there,

I wanted to share a special offer for loyal FLEX customers. For a limited time, you can get a subscription upgrade and save $16 on your next order.

Here?s how it works: Moving forward, we?ll send you a 3-month supply of FLEX (24 discs for $29) instead of a one-month supply (8 discs for $15). That?s the same number of discs for $16 less. 

By shipping every three months, we can cut down waste over 60% and save on shipping costs, which means we can pass those savings along to you. As always, shipping is included and you can skip, adjust your frequency, or cancel anytime.

Just reply ?Y? for yes to this email, and I?ll apply the $16 discount for all of your upcoming orders.

Hi Rachel,

I want to start by saying thank you. Today is our one year anniversary of shipping FLEX and you have been with us since the beginning. The past year has been quite the journey and I feel so lucky to have gone through it with you.

 
I know you love FLEX and are probably already talking to friends about it. Well, now it's time to get paid for talking about it by enrolling in the affiliate program we setup exclusively for our most loyal customers (that's you!) 
 
Your friends will get $3 off their first order and you'll get 30% of their first and second order! We'll send you cash straight to your Paypal account, and there's no limit -- you can invite as many people as you'd like, making as much money as you'd like! 
 
Enrolling is easy, just reply to this email and I'll send you a link and personalized code to share with your friends. 
 
Should I go ahead and send you a link? 
 
Cheers,
Erika

Greetings Ms. Wang:

This email is to ask for your help to assist our ministry to continue making a positive impact on our community. 

There are many aspects to our ministry, but part of it includes discipling people to learn how to become Kingdom Citizens in order to experience the abundant life Jesus promised. In order to accomplish this, we offer retreats and trainings. Our Ladies Retreat is an annual event. At these retreats we help establish value in a person. I have personally witnessed many women experience deliverance and healings from addiction, poverty, depression, and anxiety. These experiences are priceless for those who have the ability to participate. Unfortunately, not all can afford to attend. We do not turn anyone away and usually absorb the cost. This year we are reaching out to various businesses to assist us. The annual cost of these can exceed $1500. We are not asking for you to fund the entire retreat, only that you would consider sponsoring one lady to attend, which is only $100.

Anything you give will be a blessing. Just like the parable where Jesus used the fishes and loaves to feed a multitude, we are trusting and believing that God will bless exponentially any donation you are able to give. 

Let me offer our gratitude in advance. 

As a reminder, we are a 501(c)3 and all donations are tax deductible. 

You may send checks or money orders made payable to Abundant Life Church at the address listed above.
You can also give through PayPal our user name is @livingnabundance


God Bless you, your family, and your business.

"According to my account I was supposed to have a shipment shipped to me on 7/7/18. A few days before that I received an email that my shipment was a little late and would now ship on 7/12 and that I should expect it by the end of the week. It is now 7/29 and I have not yet received the 3 month supply. My period has come and gone this month and luckily I had some extra due to travel schedule and not wanting to test a new product while traveling. I am however now out and am worried as my account shows that the next product will not ship until 10/7 and I dont have any left.

I think this is an amazing product and I was sold the first time I used it. As much as I love it though, if I cant rely on the product to ship on schedule, I'm not sure that i feel comfortable relying on unreliable delivery.

Please let me know when I can expect to receive the July shipment.

Thank you.

Hi!  I opened a bag of 24 discs about a week ago + was very concerned by the strong smell.  After a week, the smell has not dissipated.  I am not willing to risk using this product.  

It may only be the wrappers that smell so strongly, but when I took a disc out of the packaging, I couldn't tell.  Thus, I am hoping for either a replacement or refund for that one shipment.  

It is almost like a burnt plastic, chemical smell.  When I zip the larger bag shut, I can't smell it.  Only when I open it.  The product appears normal visually.

Please advise.

Thank you kindly,
Amber Riley",273150

Hi Veronica,

We?ve got some great news and some not so great news.

The great news is that there are thousands of people like you using FLEX as their primary period product! The not so great news is that we didn?t expect to be this popular and we?re experiencing slight delays in shipping.

We are doing everything we can to get you FLEX as soon as possible so you can have it when you need it. We?ve expedited your shipment so it will ship by the end of this week and reach you by the beginning of next week. If your cycle is coming up sooner, just reply to this email and let us know. We?ll do our best to help you out.

To thank you for your patience, we are adding a $3 credit to your account that will be applied to your next order of FLEX.

Hi Querestyn,

The Holiday season is coming and unfortunately so are shipping delays.

Due to overwhelming package volume this Holiday season, all of the major carriers including UPS and the USPS are experiencing delays in processing shipments. 

This could mean a 3 to 7 day delay in receiving your next Flex shipment.

Given periods don?t wait for the mail, we recommend you ship your products now (https://trk.klclick1.com/ls/click?upn=rrhvyJmnIAFv7avyRI6elF56dKL5GR9q4g0MKz3ZSjusOFF9bhsb5biGAO1OmyuJDIoeseAthvmfuVz5wC2DwfeGdqHeXKcFlHFibUW2fojUMZwYy0AAfnhUXnDU-2BGH8hl3WACkQqvrvHLhHNyrlQYNW7Iv-2BnKmVA00A9NGhTLEKVkuSnpXi5dd3NKBYpKu6U8pYdr5SuyDAFA5ndNjgldZLubPBd4GlDWT8LNLlI2pZ8n1VV2BHUOdZmkOkg-2FW2-2BnhfVFrKum7YdPsvUoCuvV5qsoAKdUKn2OllmMTN1Wb-2BIpp3OvYFFXdxIlQPTyWWVqjtiyFAnDrgrqN6Xxrd5d-2F116IwzwSGhNsERJ5YgjAZ3sn8w4KcoIWxt0WM15pqgI-2FfOrwLscsI8spQeZbUMAmbPyi6-2FI-2Fj-2FdECevJFYAr-2Fz8yA-2BOfnrq9S2LU4MPHIHCWr_KW-2FGQLp4VTYxFkISjTQse5tGmkR9HrV1gE126Hj5pn1Mul5SFinEuHoavqq-2B0tH-2BUGsWaPYZW51hzNYW7RToDHs6Bb6DlHchd3p12mkUgw9urzuBCx0ADNS9x2RO45Ktbd2EYGY047fiJBrXFVTLv8IksE4afvnlUQSuJgshVa9wlJF5hb6toUaWxS9qXK-2FOybHhfPc1hCC08XXGjvILUupYDLjCstLZ72LVvtdl0lbl9B3BYF22PR6-2BPRuKWGmBFqEaLCV9pmQ1uI34gPjNw3WuPmRRJptUe00tyn3A8BrbvRY0v3pss7Y-2BQmkgTBgEjFvW5QbBCLSOwS-2B23qXJFu5sk-2B6l3J9QaGwmecrxVeUyAIyGPpYZUfEB8MT8ERSzopyxDRQdSwIUIBqDpZ9iNw-3D-3D) to ensure your order arrives as close to your originally scheduled date as possible.

Hi Kimberly,

How?s it going?

I saw you cancelled your FLEX membership recently and just wanted to apologize that it didn't work out.

We?ve found that only 33% of people use FLEX successfully within their first cycle. The other 66% of us need up to 2 full boxes.

I?d love to get another box out to you to try and help you through it this time. Can I reactivate your membership? Just reply with Y for yes or N for no and I?ll take care of the rest.

We can do this!

"Actually I do have a question. How do you know if you need to change it? I know it can stay in for 12 hours, but I have a feeling that at my heaviest times, I might need to change it sooner. With tampons, I change it if it leaks (which can happen after 15 mins to 4 hours depending on what my flow is like) or if nothing has leaked after like 6-8 hours. So basically, how do I know when the Flex is full and needs to be dumped?

Thank you! 

All those who wander, are not lost.

"Actually I do have a question. Ive heard of people getting tampons stuck in there vagina and having to get them surgically removed. How do you get the flex out with no string. If it gets pushed far back in the vagina hole to the point your finger cant reach it. For one it says having mess free period sex. Well my bfs penis is def. longer than my finger so if it gets pushed back further during sex how do you get it out? Seems very confusing?

Hello Katie,

I'm Helena, your designated Flexpert.

Trying FLEX can seem daunting, even a little intimidating at first. But I wanted to let you know that you're not alone. I've been there and use FLEX myself so please consider me a guide through the trial process.

A little about me...
   
   - My friends and family live for my character impressions - from Cher, to Julia Childs, to Lois from Family Guy.
   - I'm addicted to true crime everything - books, podcasts, shows. Not on my watch! ;)
   - On a Friday night, you'll find me having a glass of wine, binging one of my fave shows, and snuggling with my sweet pup, Willie.

My Period Profile
   
   - I started my period on my 14th birthday at a bowling alley party.
   - I've tried pads, tampons, period panties, cups. I've done it all!
   - I have a medium flow and my cycle is predictable - unlike my love life.

My First Time Trying Flex

I was really nervousÿand had to take a few deep breaths, but it was way easier than I thought it would be. Now, my first removal was another story. A comical disaster, but lesson learned. Pee before you remove is all I'll say. ;)

Want to chat about FLEX? Or maybe just say hey? Ask me anything - I've heard it all (nothing is TMI).

xx

Helena

Things You Should Know About Me


	There's nothing I love more than parmesan cheese.
	I got my first period when I was 11. I thought I was prepared for it until it actually happened???I think I cried for about 2 whole hours; the hormones combined with the idea I'd have to deal with blood??coming out of an area that was extremely confusing to me at the time for basically the rest of my life freaked me out. Can you tell I was a dramatic kid???
	I have a really heavy flow and pretty gnarly cramps. Most months it feels like my vagina/uterus betrayed me, but I power through it because I'm a badass and so are you.
	My first crush ever was Bill Nye the Science Guy. (Still going strong btw... it's weird, I know, stop judging me??please.)


Things I'd love to know about you:


	What's your go-to tv show or podcast?
	What's your sign?
	Do you know whether or not Bill Nye is single?




My First Time Trying FLEX

It was pretty easy, I was scared, but quickly realized that my biggest issue was that I was overthinking it. Once I relaxed and tried it a couple time, I got it to stay in the right spot. Now, I use my FLEX discs on my lighter days, and my Flex Cup on the heavier ones.

Using discs and the cup has completely changed my definition of what TMI means; I used to be very shy, and self-conscious about my body/period. But now, I will literally have a conversation about my vagina just as casually as I'd talk about my foot or arm. I've never felt more empowered to be myself.??

Let me know if you have any questions about using your disc; I've heard it all! Or if you just want to say hello, that's okay too!

It was pretty easy, I was scared, but quickly realized that my biggest issue was that I was overthinking it. Once I relaxed and tried it a couple time, I got it to stay in the right spot. Now, I use my FLEX discs on my lighter days, and my Flex Cup on the heavier ones.

Using discs and the cup has completely changed my definition of what TMI means; I used to be very shy, and self-conscious about my body/period. But now, I will literally have a conversation about my vagina just as casually as I'd talk about my foot or arm. I've never felt more empowered to be myself. 

Let me know if you have any questions about using your disc; I've heard it all! Or if you just want to say hello, that's okay too!

Hi Briana,

Just checking in again quickly because you?ve been a FLEX subscriber for a few months and I want to offer you your subscription for $15/month instead of $20/month.

We'll upgrade your order so you'll get a 24 pack of FLEX shipped every 3 months (charged quarterly) instead of an 8 pack shipped every month (charged monthly). As always shipping is free and you can skip, adjust your frequency, or cancel at anytime.

Can I upgrade your order and knock $5/month off your FLEX subscription? Reply Y for yes or N for no and I?ll take care of the rest.

"Actually, I think I'd like to cancel my subscription. I'm almost done with my first period using flex and it's been messy and not what I expected. My period is so heavy that I've had to use at least four of them per day on my heavy days (and even then I've had leaking). And my period usually lasts five or six days, so there's no way 8/month would work for me. 
I really like the idea behind flex, but I just don't think they're right for me. How do I go about stopping my subscription before the next charge?

Hi Sarah,

We have some great news for you! We?ve heard from our customers that $45 charged quarterly can be cost prohibitive so we?ve updated our subscription to be charged monthly to help offset the cost.

There is no action required for you. Once your trial period is over, you?ll automatically be switched over to an 8 pack shipped and billed monthly at $15. This change will be reflected on your account page within 48 hours. If you need more than 8 discs per month let us know and we?ll hook you up.

Our goal at The Flex Company is to deliver life changing period products to everyone. We?re constantly working to fulfill that mission and want to make sure you always have FLEX on hand when you need it.

Thank you for being such an awesome customer.

Thanks,

"Actually, what?s worse than ruining your favorite jeans (there are ways to get those clean!) is when a company who refuses to answer you or provide any customer service? offers a discount on a product that doesn?t work!   

Seriously?!   You know it leaked and didn?t work and you want me to give you MORE MONEY for the SAME PRODUCT?!!!   

I wanted to send back the UNOPENED 2nd package that was sent to me and hoped to get a refund, since that unopened bag could have been put back in stock. 

And I received NO response whatsoever.  If there was a policy of no returns, even unopened? ok.  But ZERO RESPONSE?   Not a great way to run a start-up.  

I realize this won?t get a response either, but on the off-chance that someone might read it?.  you may want to rethink how you are handling customer ?service?.

"Actually, yes...

I ordered this product way ahead of time because I got off the shot and was waiting for my cycle to return. Now I'm actually getting to use Flex, and the insertion isn't really a problem, but leaking is. I'm not flowing so heavy that it overflows, but I'm concerned that maybe my tilted uterus might a problem?

Hi Danielle, nice to meet you! I?m Kat, your designated Flexpert.

Things You Should Know About Me

1. I started my period during the first day of soccer tryouts in 7th grade.
2. I know all of the lines in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets movie.
3. I?ve been to the last 6 Dapper Days at Disneyland.

Why We Were Matched Up / My Period Profile

1. I used to wear tampons like clockwork. Running to the bathroom every 2 hours to change it and it was terrible! I was nervous about trying FLEX because I was worried it would hurt, but I was stunned and pleasantly surprised when I tried and could actually not feel FLEX.
2. I have a heavy-to-medium flow depending on the day of my cycle. I can tell when it?s coming since I?ll start eating all of the chocolate and happy-crying to videos of puppies and kids getting adopted.

My First Time Trying FLEX

I couldn't get insertion right, which was super frustrating! I tried different positions until I found one that worked for me (one leg up on the tub!). Once I got that down, it was smooth sailing! Now my period week is a breeze!

Want to chat about FLEX?  Or maybe just say hey? Ask me anything (nothing is TMI)!

Always here for you when you need me - even in the bathroom! :)

Hello Keela customers!

We have good news! We've produced all Size A cups and are currrently running Size B on the line. This means we'll be able to start shipping orders in approximately two weeks! 

As Jane's co-founder and product design specialist, I am writing my first update to you because I want to share the behind the scenes journey. We want you to have the most innovative cup in the world, which is why we spent so many months refining the design and ensuring the manufacturing process was of the highest quality.
 

DESIGN
We added several features to the cup since the original design launched on Kickstarter. Those changes were guided by feedback from many of you (thank you), and took time to perfect. These features include:

* An easy to re-thread stem and easy to clean seal
The seal is right at the bottom of the cup and easy to access. It's large enough to get in and clean, and the loop stem easily threads through the seal, making it easy to undo and redo the stem.
* Easy to grasp loop
Our original design had a ball shaped end to the stem, which was good, but when things got a little slippery, it was difficult for some to grasp. That's why we invented this easy to grasp loop and make it in a way that still passed through the seal easily. 
* Easy to fold and insert shape
The profile of the upper rim area is specifically designed to collapse into the smallest shape possible and stay there during insertion.
* Leak resistant rim shape and springy-ness
We invested time in getting the ring springy-ness (highly technicaly term) just right so it perfectly pops open and is amazing at preventing leaks.

MATERIALS
We only use medical grade silicone and medical grade pigment. That's it!

MANUFACTURING
Unfortunately, once we passed the design over to our US based manufacturing partner, there were a number of delays completely out of our control. But in each case, we insisted on options that ensured the highest quality and tried to be as transparent with you as possible. Here's a quick look into the delays we experienced:

* Figuring out the mold shape
This cup is pretty out-of-the-box as far as its shape with the stem, and it required some deep thinking to design a mold shape that could do the job.
* Improving the flash at the stem-cup interface
Once we had the mold completed, we minimized and almost eliminated the ""flash"" line at the parting line of the mold. 
* Texturing the mold for extra softness
We bead blasted our mold surface to give at an extra soft feel.
* Using heat to harden the mold
Once that was done, we had to head harden the mold. This is a process where you heat up the steel of the mold and then cool it slowly to harden the mold, which ensures that the mold does not deviate in quality or shape or surface texture over time.
* Adjusting the mold after heating to bring it back into shape
The heat hardening step unexpectedly moved a part of the mold by about half the thickness of a hair, but enough that we noticed. So we adjusted the mold to get it in line and perfcet. And now we are up and running parts!

Hi Rachel! I?m Merissa, your designated flexpert.

Why We Were Matched Up / My Period Profile

1. I used to use a menstrual cup, which gave me lots-o-extra time but ended up being painful and needy. FLEX gave me my life back without the hurt - I actually can?t feel it at all. 
2. I have a really heavy flow (I fill a super tampon in 1-3 hours) and cramps that felt like a mosh pit in my stomach.

Things You Should Know About Me

1. I started my period when I was 10 at a waterpark and was so confused! My mom wasn?t there and my dad got to handle it (like a champ, might I add).
2. I?m an avid runner and love being outside - movement is everything.
3. I grew up in a super small town. It has a population of just over 3,000, most of which are my family.

I was charged for the 15 dollar 3 month trial though (and you say it wasn't actually canceled) but I have heard nothing about if the product was actually shipped or not. So I'm wondering if it was shipped and if not, can I get a refund for the 15 dollars since I never received anything and it's been 10 days.

If you received an order cancellation email last night, I want to let you know that your order for the $15 three-month trial of FLEX is still going out and that has nothing changed with your order. There was a slight issue with our fulfillment provider DHL not recognizing orders from our system.  While processing the orders, automatic cancelation e-mails were sent out even though we created new ""readable"" orders.
 
Apologies for any confusion this might have caused! I personally take responsibility for this one. Feel free to email us back if you still have any questions.

Best,

Winnie

I have attached some photos of an older & newer Softdisc 'design' for comparison.

The thinner, newer, sleeker Softdiscs slip out of place and leak.  I'm so disappointed in the new design.  

Can you tell me if the older design is still available or will be in the future?  Thank you.

I know the slim fit is highly recommended for beginners, but it only holds 2 super tampons .. which would mean I would be in trouble on my heaviest day.
Do you think I should still go with the Slim Fit? Or the Full Fit?

"After several months of attempted use of Flex, I really began to wonder if I could be so dumb as to not be able to figure it out, or if I really was part of a small minority of women whom it didn?t ?fit.? However, after a lengthy conversation with Jillian, I realised it was not in fact me, but the actual literature and website of Flex. The one thing that was true was that she really was the girl on the other side of the stall, the only problem was, my problems didn?t have solutions. The following is a personal account of my use of Flex over 3-4 months. 

Finding a way for flex to sit inside you is not easy, does not make sense, and is counter-intuitive. I think all said, it was correctly inserted 4-6x. The rest of the time, though I was pushing ?back? and ?down? I experienced heavy leaking, and it was a mess to try to fix. The time that flex says it is allowed to be inserted for is grossly overstated, and the quantity is so limited in the ?per month? amount, you are almost forced to try to leave it for as long as stated. This leads me to two additional problems. The first being that Jillian first explained to me the time limit doesn?t work for her either, but she simply ?rinses? out flex and reinserts it. This is nowhere in any literature or online. It does not even suggest that this could be an option. As ladies who are used to disposable products, I do not believe it is even close to likely this is something we would naturally consider doing. Not to mention the extreme inconvenience and sometimes plain impossibility of doing so. I find it even more challenging to begin to know when is ready to remove, when you are next to promised a 12h window. Now for the actual removal process. Hooking one?s finger under the edge and removing is not a clean process! Though all the explanations would lead you to believe that you will have a ?mess free? removal if your finger is under the edge. How disheartening when time and time again, you are reaching ever so carefully as to grab the edge and pulling so so gently so not to have a giant bloody explosion. Well, it never happened for me. Each time I removed flex, it was as if a bomb had gone off in and around the toilet. If you had managed to keep track of the tiny awkward wrapper that your flex came in, and provided it hadn?t completely torn in half (75% of the time, it did) when you opened it, you could now attempt to ?dump? it directly back in the black wrapper. This is not an effective removal. Neither is the ?rinse and reinsert? method. I am a woman who is a chef, a sailor, and lives in a city. I do not have complete and unfettered access to a private toilet and/or sink. Not to mention my breaks sometimes are for mere minutes to use the toilet and even after all the hand washing of this removal process, I do not feel ready to touch ready-to-eat foods immediately afterward. This type of removal on a boat can be extremely difficult because the menses are not ?absorbed? in a way that a cotton tampax does. At any point thereafter, they can drip, spill or otherwise come OUT of the black wrapper. Sometimes at sea we must consolidate our waste for a matter of weeks before we are able to remove it completely from the vessel. There really should be a more absorbent or compact disposal container. Mess-free period sex I only wish was true, but instead the blood got all over my japanese kimono. It obviously wasn?t as much as it would have been without it, but I really didn?t consider it to be without mess. I really thought this would allow me to not wake up in the middle of the night to change and simply enjoy rest, but I found any time I slept in it to have leaks. I am still uncertain as to whether those leaks were because it didn?t hold enough menses or because it wasn?t correctly inserted. I really felt that I knew where and how it was meant to be inserted but after some time it simply ?moved? out of position. I also had to readjust every time I used the toilet (and at 8x/day like the average woman) I found that exhausting. 

Some suggestions I have are as follows. Update your materials, tell the girls how it is. I don?t know anyone who has tried it (and I have had 3 gfs in my circles do so) and been able to leave inserted for more than 1/2 the amount of time (6h is the max anyone has been able to do). Be straight about the necessity to rinse and reinsert, in order to be able to get through your cycle with the allotted amount. Or give more flex per cycle. Either could work. Redesign the container it comes in. Almost impossible to open the ?correct? way to be able to dispose of later, a simple adhesive strip could make it better to close afterward, or something to prevent it from tearing all the way open at the first opening. Perhaps something that would stretch to accommodate a full flex afterward, like a bin liner with little pockets that move with the contents. 

Apart from the actual fit, I suppose that there are a lot of things about flex I simply felt that the website and literature ignored. This is not only unfair to women using this product, but cruel. We are already brave enough to try a new product, and to believe the promises that are at the heart of your product. ?mess free? and ?12H?

Hi Lala, nice to meet you! I?m Kat, your designated Flexpert.

Things You Should Know About Me

1. I started my period during the first day of soccer tryouts in 7th grade.
2. I know all of the lines in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets movie.
3. I?ve been to the last 6 Dapper Days at Disneyland.

Why We Were Matched Up / My Period Profile

1. I used to wear tampons like clockwork. Running to the bathroom every 2 hours to change it and it was terrible! I was nervous about trying FLEX because I was worried it would hurt, but I was stunned and pleasantly surprised when I tried and could actually not feel FLEX.
2. I have a heavy-to-medium flow depending on the day of my cycle. I can tell when it?s coming since I?ll start eating all of the chocolate and happy-crying to videos of puppies and kids getting adopted.

My First Time Trying FLEX

I couldn't get insertion right, which was super frustrating! I tried different positions until I found one that worked for me (one leg up on the tub!). Once I got that down, it was smooth sailing! Now my period week is a breeze!

Want to chat about FLEX?  Or maybe just say hey? Ask me anything (nothing is TMI)!

Always here for you when you need me - even in the bathroom! :)

Hi Jordan,

Hi Jordan

This is Kat from FLEX. I'm so sorry to hear you had some trouble with your FLEX discs, but I'm excited you're giving it another shot and want you to succeed! To help you with your next try, I've added a 50% off coupon to your account automatically.  

If it's feeling uncomfortable, you probably may need to adjust the way you insert the disc. Keep in mind there are lots of different ways to insert FLEX discs and preferred methods will vary from person to person. 

The keys to successful insertion are: 

1. Finding a good position. Sitting, squatting, standing with a leg elevated, sitting with legs propped up? the list goes on. Find a position that makes the most sense for you and your body. This alone can make all the difference. 

2. Inserting the disc down and back.Keep in mind how far down and back will depend on your unique anatomy. For some people, this. might mean the disc goes in at a slight angle, for others it might mean the disc is pushed directly down towards the floor. 

3. Making sure the disc is tucked behind the pubic bone. Again, your unique anatomy will play a role. Some people won't need to do a thing while others will use their index finger to prop the disc up behind the pubic bone after inserting the disc.  

One insertion method that tends to work for most users is the ""Thumb Trick."" You can learn all about this method here (https://trk.klclick1.com/ls/click?upn=rrhvyJmnIAFv7avyRI6elE2ehM-2BcdQCawdQ6SpkT1YYGiHJ1DFPgIFDnYTFArAyR3uaNwJO0zM-2FVHQ-2Bhv-2BZ1g6t-2FKqfd466rqEsARmpPizvhB3GUEVDenS7aBBbf8dZnOiPDxc8OCVTd7z9PIg1VFzYzSJzj2wpUTMWlqf66GdU7KHRzu2rwnvs-2BVwv2z1hn-2FWHJrlUZMV6xY8s9tAQtkd3czQ7Lo-2BaywqT-2FzFKIxpURPXuPw1tH5CmJ8d2qvmXi1TLwXiVk9kl-2B-2FYiclOqDaotS-2BzwSI3d5mHFJXvQk9-2BN4GNML7Ofee-2BnM38ifw5jGTNUXw11qqFVI9BpyO33yg5arsk-2Bq3-2BSP2FkHNJGchMg-3DC38M_t6rNZH6dypDIrJB92PWRvjAEgmCC-2BYiGUfSn2evFIz0ks3yrSdsy5TF0x4b8eRBADUqqrJMx2jK10swp6X1Dh6qnFi3cBQcbhAu1e3GnOvg9aGfjVUXm9hMfEqNG5tZ5JNBcx10Q59S3WnXt7TGX0Abmo4fhjImHDuUGVpu80kj6iPk1J4kXnvG5-2By5-2FsNcIkX7boW7wgUeUFHhewE-2FaPcmXgArVZ8kceLaXRPH221fj8E6Rif6qkTfEcNEcvJiDYGOco8tQlxWFaYW6KoBYDZcutQ6TTPbyb2mdPGrHtnfzZ1fjxzZC8WdmNsBRPFZl7BSjqBDo0me1CP6T23fOz-2FyqkIFSPL9ZlJ1LdV4K6S1dgHYRCfI6AsrBgG3e28hz2fG23maRTTKPmmcwRmWSCg-3D-3D) .

If you?re still having issues such as leaking, remember:

1. Leaking while going to the bathroom is normal. Just be sure to push the disc back in place with a clean finger afterwards. You can also do a kegel exercise. Speaking of?

2. Do kegel exercises regularly. Not only can kegels help with insertion, they?re great to do regularly throughout the day to help keep the disc in place should it shift from movement or bodily functions.

3. Empty your disc - hands-free! To do this, you?ll want to bear down on your disc while going to the bathroom. This will make the disc pop out from behind the pubic bone allowing the contents to empty into the toilet. *Just make sure the disc is back in place afterwards!

Thanks for all the information. I do have some questions/ concerns about Flex. But I get there here is a bit about me:

2. What's your sign? Sagittarius 
3. Do you know whether or not Bill Nye is single? Certainly, don't know. 

Now that you these basics, I'd like to know how to use Flex better. I do not know if I am postioning it correctly.  For the 2nd month in a row, all goes well until about the 4-6hr. After that period I can not seem to keep the disk the way it oughta be. It feel comfortable, but I'm wondering if I am putting too far or not in a secure enough spot. 

Any thoughts on this would be helpful,
SPJ

Hi SHANNON,

I?m Zori, your designated Flexpert!

Things you should know about me

1. There's nothing I love more than parmesan cheese.
2. I got my first period when I was 11. I thought I was prepared for it until it actually happened?I think I cried for about 2 whole hours; the hormones combined with the idea I'd have to deal with blood coming out of an area that was extremely confusing to me at the time for basically the rest of my life freaked me out. Can you tell I was a dramatic kid? 
3. I have a really heavy flow and pretty gnarly cramps. Most months it feels like my vagina/uterus betrayed me, but I power through it because I'm a badass and so are you.
4. My first crush ever was Bill Nye the Science Guy. (Still going strong btw... it's weird, I know, stop judging me please.)

Things I'd love to know about you:

1. What's your go-to tv show or podcast?

My First Time Trying FLEX

It was pretty easy, I was scared, but quickly realized that my biggest issue was that I was overthinking it. Once I relaxed and tried it a couple time, I got it to stay in the right spot. Now, I use my FLEX discs on my lighter days, and my Flex Cup on the heavier ones.

Using discs and the cup has completely changed my definition of what TMI means; I used to be very shy, and self-conscious about my body/period. But now, I will literally have a conversation about my vagina just as casually as I'd talk about my foot or arm. I've never felt more empowered to be myself. 

Let me know if you have any questions about using your disc; I've heard it all! Or if you just want to say hello, that's okay too!

 How long after you order do you typically receive email confirmation. I ordered on the 24th with no contact yet.

Thank you!??

Hi there, nice to meet you! I?m Kat, your designated Flexpert.

Things You Should Know About Me

1. I started my period during the first day of soccer tryouts in 7th grade.
2. I know all of the lines in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets movie.
3. I?ve been to the last 6 Dapper Days at Disneyland.

Why We Were Matched Up / My Period Profile

1. I used to wear tampons like clockwork. Running to the bathroom every 2 hours to change it and it was terrible! I was nervous about trying FLEX because I was worried it would hurt, but I was stunned and pleasantly surprised when I tried and could actually not feel FLEX.
2. I have a heavy-to-medium flow depending on the day of my cycle. I can tell when it?s coming since I?ll start eating all of the chocolate and happy-crying to videos of puppies and kids getting adopted.

My First Time Trying FLEX

I couldn't get insertion right, which was super frustrating! I tried different positions until I found one that worked for me (one leg up on the tub!). Once I got that down, it was smooth sailing! Now my period week is a breeze!

Want to chat about FLEX?  Or maybe just say hey? Ask me anything (nothing is TMI)!

Always here for you when you need me - even in the bathroom! :)

"Afternoon,

I know that you are very busy so I will be very short.

You have your website on Shopify and therefore probably have an expensive
payment solution (Stripe or Klarna).

Checkout.com can be activated in one-click and allow you to drastically
reduce your cost (0.60% per transaction). This is because we are an
acquirer in direct and don't use a third party bank to process your
payments.

Because you might also have some fraud/chargebacks, we offer 3D secure (for
free) allowing you to have all your payments guaranteed.

We already process for all the biggest brand on Shopify (Simbasleep,
Huel...) and would be happy to add a brand like yours.

Could we have a quick chat to further discuss?

Kind regards,
Edward.

"Afternoon,

I never recieved my first order dated 11th October 2019 (#9585). But was happy to let this slide as we were in the middle of a house move.

I woke up this morning to a paypal notification that confirmed another $40 was debited from my paypal account.

Unfortunately I never realised it was a recharge subscription so never cancelled or updated to my new address.

I have now incurred $80 charge without receiving a single product. This second batch was sent 11th January (#11346) and to my old address of:

Flat 34 Fontaine Court,
45 Highstreet,
N146LW

My partner is keen for the product and I was wondering if anything can be done?

My new address is:

83A Cranborne Road,
Potters Bars,
EN63AQ

Please help me resolve this matter and if I ever recieve the product we will consider continuing with the subscription.

Please help.

Kind regards,

Phillip Li

Agh!!! I pushed up my order because I?m going out of town on Sunday to DC for my 10th wedding anniversary and of course I?m set to start my period the day we leave ???????  I?m a first time flex user (although I?m a former NuvaRing pro) and I?ve practiced with one of the Flex rings I got in my trial order today... I feel confident about using it but I?m scared I won?t have enough for our trip (because my period is HEAVY for a 2-3 days thanks to pregnancy induced hypothyroidism) and I just got the notice it will take 5-7 days to get my order...Not sure what the best course of action is???  I am REALLY looking forward to this product not ruining our ?sexy time? on our trip because our 8 and 5 year olds ruin that daily ????,163328
"Ah can I cancel this??? I didn?t realize I signed up for a subscription, I thought I had to opt in after the trail. I don?t need this many!!!

Kat here on the Customer Experience team at Flex! I noticed that you have multiple active subscriptions for Flex products. Does that sound correct to you?

Hi Diana,

I'm Erika, cofounder of The Flex Company - nice to e-meet you! Lauren sent me your email after you filled out our Softcup survey (thank you!) because she noticed that you were looking to buy Softcup online. 

While we don't sell Softcup online, we do sell our other menstrual disc, FLEX, directly through our website. We also offer subscriptions for $15/month so you never have to worry about your local store being out of stock. I realize you love Softcup but until we can get more retailers stocking the product consistently, I don't want you running out. 

For a limited time we're offering a 3 month trial (24 discs) of FLEX for only $15 + free shipping so you can try it out and see if you like it as much as Softcup. You can order your trial here (http://the-flex-company-1.trk.klaviyomail.com/wf/click?upn=gE02jo8QEQs-2FEOLihAE5V53Bckb9X6T9gnyvtGZLgYO7-2FuAVduOux8I7Pi2ErkM7VAr4gGMf9RzMqbZsmzi72V-2BLBqI6rY0cyVpGrEr3NExwc8ONvaOrFWe4lIV2QmOeDiAtW-2BBW6FGLe3fJ91-2FVoAxhZu3xE5nUf5y7gBh4ieo-3D_PlW1Zj4M7yZhep8YPM48SHzDjXh9o4XMf6YBerX8SnH3ubGzteKx9aCsuxx69F1QXwX06EbjihasBCJf1GxV94pjATIkyoSNhNVh2nQihzTom0xRZ9Ar0sblqpnjv8S41QD1JMd6IcByNjDtLlw4rJf5tx6evejy-2FEdIT0TxQJIqd7IJYM1nUPZk1jjj5cX6MK9wf3BTRg-2BlTy7NHntj-2BuG-2Fbr-2FN7q79ibhgtlDsYo8NBATMcIj-2B3yr-2BidS1meqgF3fr-2B37J-2F7yqHtgW4siDr4Dska5FshVnafjbzToBrdnQZhh7nhiae1x6V0F3vhPp3BeEzfB5r0vcHS4yjAUbtvdRvEteCyYjQb-2FK8lsnrgZ0vhYMpdNIkaENUEVo4DXh) .

Hi Miranda! I?m Merissa, your designated Flexpert.

Why We Were Matched Up / My Period Profile

1. I used to use a menstrual cup, which gave me lots-o-extra time but ended up being painful and needy. FLEX gave me my life back without the hurt - I actually can?t feel it at all. 
2. I have a really heavy flow (I fill a super tampon in 1-3 hours) and cramps that felt like a mosh pit in my stomach.

Things You Should Know About Me

1. I started my period when I was 10 at a waterpark and was so confused! My mom wasn?t there and my dad got to handle it (like a champ, might I add).
2. I?m an avid runner and love being outside - movement is everything.
3. I grew up in a super small town. It has a population of just over 3,000, most of which are my family.

My First Time Trying FLEX

I tried FLEX on my heaviest day and found what looked like a war-zone in my chonies. Yes, leaks can happen while you're getting used to FLEX. But I?m now enjoying the most comfortable, leak-free period of my life! <3

Hi Courtney! I?m Merissa, your designated Flexpert.

Why We Were Matched Up / My Period Profile
   
   - I used to use a menstrual cup, which gave me lots-o-extra time but ended up being painful and needy. FLEX gave me my life back without the hurt - I actually can?t feel it at all.ÿ
   - I have a really heavy flow (I fill a super tampon in 1-3 hours) and cramps that felt like a mosh pit in my stomach.

Things You Should Know About Me
   
   - I started my period when I was 10 at a waterpark and was so confused! My mom wasn?t there and my dad got to handle it (like a champ, might I add).
   - I?m an avid runner and love being outside - movement is everything.
   - I grew up in a super small town. It has a population of just over 3,000, most of which are my family.

"Ahhhh I definitely need some help! lol 

I ordered the flex cup & flex discs a few weeks before my period so this wasn't relevant until now. So far I have only been using the cup.

I first tried putting in the flex cup on Sunday, a day before my period. The first time I put the cup in, I'm not exactly sure what happened but it's like it started to flip inside out. I could tell it wasn't right so I took it out, but I was unfamiliar with it so I am not exactly sure what happened/how it happened. The next time I put it in, I thought I did it correctly but honestly wasn't super confident about it. 

The next day I didn't try to put in the flex cup until I started my period. It seemed like the same thing happened the first time & it didn't feel right. I put it in again & thought it was in there correctly. Later in the afternoon I was laying on the couch & I felt what I thought was air leaving my vagina but I got up to check & the blood had spilled out some. I cleaned the cup & inserted it again. 

The next day when I tried putting the flex cup in, somehow the release ring pulled down past the stopper and it was stuck like that when I removed it (I could tell right away that it wasn't in right so immediately removed it). I tried putting it back in & it seemed to be correct, I ran my finger around to make sure that it was opened & it seemed like it was. Later that day I felt a similar air sensation while sitting at my desk - it had leaked some again. 

This morning I thought for sure I had it correct! I put it in while in the shower & it felt like it was for sure opened all the way & in the correct spot. All was good until a couple hours later when I was pooping and it almost fell all the way out! I had issues the past couple days with it coming partially out of my vagina when I was pooping but this time I was honestly afraid it was going to come all the way out. I have a digestive disorder and spend a lot of time pooping or trying to poop (lol) so it's really important to me that this doesn't happen. I started having issues with tampons coming out when using the bathroom, which made me think to switch to another option that hopefully a) wouldn't have this issue or b) at least not be so wasteful if I have to change every time I poop. Luckily I was at home when this happened but I don't know what I would have done with the cup if I was in a public bathroom with non-private sinks. 

Please tell me you have some ideas as to what is going on!

Thank you,
Stephanie

Hello Amanda,

I'm Helena, your designated Flexpert.

Trying FLEX can seem daunting, even a little intimidating at first. But I wanted to let you know that you're not alone. I've been there and use FLEX myself so please consider me a guide through the trial process.

A little about me...

1. My friends and family live for my character impressions - from Cher, to Julia Childs, to Lois from Family Guy.
2. I'm addicted to true crime everything - books, podcasts, shows. Not on my watch! ;)
3. On a Friday night, you'll find me having a glass of wine, binging one of my fave shows, and snuggling with my sweet pup, Willie.

My Period Profile

1. I started my period on my 14th birthday at a bowling alley party.
2. I've tried pads, tampons, period panties, cups. I've done it all!
3. I have a medium flow and my cycle is predictable - unlike my love life.

My First Time Trying Flex

I was really nervous and had to take a few deep breaths, but it was way easier than I thought it would be.

This makes me feel so much better about starting Flex! I'm usually a tampon & pad person (I don't trust tampons by themselves haha) and I realized how wasteful that is; considering I would change my tampon every couple hours. I kept seeing Flex ads all over Instagram so I figured I'd give it a try! My period should be starting in the next few days (I can usually tell a week in advance because I get bloated, grumpy, and cramp-y) so  I thought I'd give Flex a go! My main concern is inserting it correctly and taking it out with no issues. I'll definitely get in touch with you when I receive my order & if I have any questions! Thank you so much for reaching out!

Hi Sadie, nice to meet you! I?m Kat, your designated Flexpert.

Things You Should Know About Me

1. I started my period during the first day of soccer tryouts in 7th grade.
2. I know all of the lines in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets movie.
3. I?ve been to the last 6 Dapper Days at Disneyland.

Why We Were Matched Up / My Period Profile

1. I used to wear tampons like clockwork. Running to the bathroom every 2 hours to change it and it was terrible! I was nervous about trying FLEX because I was worried it would hurt, but I was stunned and pleasantly surprised when I tried and could actually not feel FLEX.
2. I have a heavy-to-medium flow depending on the day of my cycle. I can tell when it?s coming since I?ll start eating all of the chocolate and happy-crying to videos of puppies and kids getting adopted.

My First Time Trying FLEX

I couldn't get insertion right, which was super frustrating! I tried different positions until I found one that worked for me (one leg up on the tub!). Once I got that down, it was smooth sailing! Now my period week is a breeze!

Want to chat about FLEX?  Or maybe just say hey? Ask me anything (nothing is TMI)!

Always here for you when you need me - even in the bathroom! :)

I would feel like an air bubble slowly move up my vagina then boom! Blood everywhere. I got up 4 times in middle of night to go to bathroom and change. I?m making sure it?s in all the way and pushing up behind pelvic bone and doing kegels. I feel as though it leaks as I?m lying down.

"All the backlash from the men in the world, possible your product could help the woman who want to not only fight for what you are fighting for, which I believe is normality, but also equality. My husband is a recon Marine and when I ask if woman are allowed to fight on the front line he quickly answers no. Me ""why"". Him ""menstruation"". If you're product touched professional sports personal then I'm sure you've reached out to the enlisted but if not. You should. It just may be the bridge to cross to get to the equality that the woman who simply want to help, like you and me.",238827
"All went well with my first time using the product and I'm loving it! l appreciate all of the outreach that you all do and your videos were super helpful! So excited I found the product :) (or it actually found me on instagram!)

Hi Ashley,

I?m Zori?YOUR DESIGNATED FLEXPERT!

than parmesan cheese. Given the opportunity, I'd probably eat an entire wheel of it. At this point, I think
it might be an unhealthy obsession, but life's short do
what you love amirite?

I thought I was prepared for it until it actually happened?I think I cried for about 2 whole hours; the hormones combined with the idea I'd have to deal with blood coming out of an area that was extremely confusing to me at the time for basically the rest of my life freaked me out. Can you tell I was a dramatic kid?

and pretty gnarly cramps. Most months it feels like my vagina/uterus betrayed me, but I power through it because I'm a badass and so are you.

Thanks for following up! I paused my subscription because I haven?t had my period for a bit and I didn?t get to finish the trial box that was sent to me. Once my period starts becoming more regular, I will likely try Flex again. Thanks and have a great day!

Sincerely,

"Aloha Flex company,

I?ve been using the flex and do like it a lot. However it seems to leak now over several periods regardless if it?s not full, but for sure the cup is in proper position and open when being used. I?m thinking I should?ve had the larger cup. Would it be possible for you all to send a replacement? 

Thank you!

It?s Nikki here - cofounder of Ma?i Movement.



As native Hawaiian women born and raised in Hawai'i, my sisters and I startedÿhttp://maimovement.org/- a nonprofit aiming to end period poverty in Hawai?i through service, advocacy and education. We recently came across your company and LOVE everything it stands for!



I?m not sure if it?s even possible, but is there any way we can form some kind of partnership? We are trying to serve girls and women of low-income homes, homeless, transgender and non-binary and incarcerated people. We are currently handing out Care Kits - a month's supply of period products - to individuals and organizations, but we would like to start incorporating more reusable products like period panties and cups! It's incredibly expensive to purchase at retail for the number we are intending to distribute. If there's an opportunity to partner or even purchase at cost for massive distribution, please let us know.

"Aloha Flex Fit!

I am reaching out to introduce myself. My name is Sam and I am the Director
of Sponsors for Rise Gatherings.

The Flex disc was first introduced to me by my friend Rachel, who happens
to be the co-founder of Rise! When I started my new role as Director of
Sponsors for Rise Gatherings <http://www.risegatherings.com> I instantly
thought of your Flex Disc and how amazing it would be to incorporate it
into our retreats.

Rise Gatherings provides retreat experiences for all women and creates
space for personal growth, collective connection and inspired well being.
In our third year now, we have connected in person with thousands of women
and will facilitate 15+ unique and accessible events in 2019.

?I don?t know how to put into words how amazing this experience was for me
except to say it?s like finally taking a deep breath and letting it out
after 40 years of holding it in.?

Rise Gathering Retreat participant

Rise stands on the pillar of collaboration as we are a platform for
wellness brands to reach their target audience and generate greater impact
in a mutually beneficial way.

With that being said, would you be interested in developing a thriving
partnership with Rise Gatherings? We would love to introduce Flex Disc to
our community!

Please check out the attached deck for more information about Rise
Gatherings and our sponsor opportunities.

We thank you for your time and thoughtful consideration!

Much love,

Sam

My name is Kelly Yazdi, and I put on the ?Wild Gypsy Tour? ?(www.WildGypsyTour.com)?. ? 

The WGT is an all-women?s motorcycle festival spearheading the rally at the Legendary Sturgis Buffalo Chip; August 3rd-7th, 2017. Our event is 5 days and 5 nights, and it focuses on sisterhood, outdoor adventure, vitality, badassery and fun.

Our team really digs your company, so thank you for existing! 

I'd love to work with your company as a sponsor/partner for the 2018 Wild Gypsy Tour event and, perhaps more importantly, develop a relationship with your brand that would last for many years to come! I believe we can create a custom package that meets your desires and goals, while simultaneously supporting our festival?s direction. At this point in time, we are still looking for various levels/types of partnerships and would ideally like to tailor a package with you! 

Would love to brainstorm with you to see if there's a way to work together for this summers event. 

Peace, love, babes and motorcycles,

I have been using the Softdisc but notice that it puts pressure on my urethra and slows the flow. Will I have the same issue with Flex? I?m pretty sure I have it in the correct place behind my pubic bone. I was hoping that since Flex is softer maybe that would help.

Thanks! Just got my flex discs today. I used to use softdiscs. I love them but they leak every time I sneeze or laugh to hard. I saw on the website that Flex has a better seal so I decided to give it a try. Any tips and tricks on how to preventing leaks?

Hi Phoebe,

I?m Zori, your designated Flexpert!

Things You Should Know About Me

1. There's nothing I love more than parmesan cheese.
2. I got my first period when I was 11. I thought I was prepared for it until it actually happened?I think I cried for about 2 whole hours; the hormones combined with the idea I'd have to deal with blood coming out of an area that was extremely confusing to me at the time for basically the rest of my life freaked me out. Can you tell I was a dramatic kid? 
3. I have a really heavy flow and pretty gnarly cramps. Most months it feels like my vagina/uterus betrayed me, but I power through it because I'm a badass and so are you.
4. My first crush ever was Bill Nye the Science Guy. (Still going strong btw... it's weird, I know, stop judging me please.)

Things I'd love to know about you:

1. What's your go-to tv show or podcast?
2. What's your sign?
3. Do you know whether or not Bill Nye is single?

My First Time Trying FLEX

It was pretty easy, I was scared, but quickly realized that my biggest issue was that I was overthinking it. Once I relaxed and tried it a couple time, I got it to stay in the right spot. Now, I use my FLEX discs on my lighter days, and my Flex Cup on the heavier ones.

Using discs and the cup has completely changed my definition of what TMI means; I used to be very shy, and self-conscious about my body/period. But now, I will literally have a conversation about my vagina just as casually as I'd talk about my foot or arm. I've never felt more empowered to be myself. 

Let me know if you have any questions about using your disc; I've heard it all! Or if you just want to say hello, that's okay too!

You are so funny! Thanks for the welcome email. 
My go-to show is definitely Friends and the podcast Serial 
I have no idea- I just say it. Haha 
And I?m pretty sure he?s happily married. 
Funny- I had the biggest crush on David Hasselhoff when I was a kid... most kids were in love with Leo DiCaprio or JTT ?? - am I showing my age? Ha 
Okay for real... 
I had a question.
I feel like I?m doing something wrong. I inset my Flex exactly how it?s shown on the website - but it seems to leak a lot. Is that normal? I mean, besides that little annoyance ... I LOVE the product! 
Help me! Ha

I am going away for a while and have not had the chance to try the disks yet so I do not know if I want more. Can you please cancel my automatic refills?

I inserted my first flex disc yesterday and I can?t reach the rim to remove it. I could feel it deep in there yesterday, but this morning I can?t even find the rim, just the plastic catch. Which I can?t seem to get a sturdy enough grip on to pull hard enough to break the seal. I think I may have done too powerful of kegels and now the seal is super tight. Help!

"Aloha, 
I just wanted you to know that shipping takes forever to Hawaii from NC and I would have appreciated if you had considered that. I?m using a gross pad because my shipment still isn?t here and I already started my period. The Flex I ordered on auto shipping won?t be here until Tuesday night. So basically when my period is almost over I?ll get them. I?m pretty bummed out in this program now. I have nice gym shark workout clothes I had planned to wear and now I have to risk leaking with either bulky diaper pads or my junk moon menstruation cup that feels like a silicone dildo inside of me for 7 days straight. 
Just please ship faster or sooner or something. I heard I could buy these at a drug store under a different brand. I may consider because of my irritation.

"?Aloha,

I ordered a flex cup a couple of months ago. I was eager to do something better for my body and for the environment by eliminating the use of tampons. I?m really frustrated because no matter what fold or insertion position I use I can?t get it to stay in and when it?s in, it feels uncomfortable and slips. I watched tutorials and read different tips on the internet and spent over an hour trying to get it in properly with no luck. After all of that I was exhausted and sore and also about ready to throw it out a window because I was so frustrated. I?d really appreciate some help with this because I feel like I just wasted $33 on something I can?t use. Especially since I?m currently furloughed from work due to COVID-19 and don?t even know if I will have a job to go back to. Thank you for your time. 

Sincerely,
Dayna Wela",223644

"Aloha, 
I recently ordered the trial box of Flex for my two young daughters. I think your product is amazing, and love everything about your company (especially those awesome ads and straight talking instructions! Thank you for that!) Almost makes me wish I still got a period. (...almost, but not quite hahaha!) 

Unfortunately, they?re still just a little too young to be ready for Flex. I was hopeful, and they were too. They gave it a shot, but they said it?s just not for them right now. At least we tried! 

As I will always respect their choices and do whatever makes them most comfortable in dealing with their periods, sadly I?m needing to cancel my subscription for now. Hopefully, as they get a little bit older, they?ll feel more comfortable and we?ll be back! 

I love that women are finally getting more options. Keep up the fantastic work!

I recently purchased a box of Softdisc at Target that had a $2 off coupon attached to it. At check out the cashier told me that it wasn?t valid. She also said that it was for another product not the one that I was purchasing. But why would it be for another producer when it says ?$2 off peel to redeem now??

I specifically purchased this product because of this exclusive coupon which I could not redeem. Is there any way to fix this? I read the details on the back of the coupon and it does not specify a product other than ?The Flex Company products?.

I was wondering if you could help me. This is my 2nd flex since I got my package on Monday. But for some reason, it keeps leaking. I work in the forest all day and I was hoping that this would help me. Every time I go to the bathroom, there are stains on my panty liner. Maybe I didn?t push it far back? But I did feel the pubic bone and did everything as instructed.. I have even tried different positions when inserting the flex disk.. so why is it still leaking? Is my middle finger too short? I have work tomorrow and need this to work since I will be out in the field all day again. Please help :(

"Aloha,

My name is Evan.

We don?t know each other.

The truth is this:

I shamelessly hunted down your email address and now I?m sending you an unsolicited cold email.

So...

You?re probably smart enough to know, by now, I?m obviously trying to sell you something.

It?s okay...

You have every right to hit reply, give me a piece of your mind, and tell me how unprofessional I am?

You can even use all CAPS to let me know you?re yelling.

I?ll understand? promise :)

However...

If you?re even the slightest bit bored with your day...

I swear that I?ll keep this email short and mildly entertaining.

Not like all those other cold emails from an obvious third world country promising.

You know the ones?

Promising to increase your web traffic or optimize your SEO?

Shit like that.

I hate those too.

Anyhoo?

I?m an email copywriter (from Canada eh) who specializes in blowing the ""revenue roof"" off the backend of ecommerce stores just like yours.

In between cups of premium dark roast coffee I like to send emails from client accounts that get results like these:


?

That big number next to the word EMAIL? that?s me.

$790,645

Yup?

45% of this client?s revenue came directly from email.

Wanna know something else really cool?

This client made more money from email this year than he made from his entire business last year.

Impressive huh?

So?

...basically...

I?m pretty good at what I do.

So, if you know your email marketing could be better...

And if you?re not pulling at least 30% of your overall sales from your back end...

Hit reply and send me a message.

We can meet on Skype or Google Hangout where you can watch me unprofessionally drink a pint of Guinness as we discuss the nature of your business.

But before you do, there?s something you should know?

Even though this email seems like it was written just for you, I can assure you that it is copied, pasted, and sent to about 200 to 300 more people.

That means a few smart and serious people are bound to message me back.

Bottom line:

If you dilly dally you might miss out.

So message me back already!

Unprofessionally yours,

Evan ?sending an honest cold email like this is probably a massive mistake? Dwyer

P.S - If for some reason you're angry about this cold email that wasted approximately 2 minutes of your life?

Here's a picture of a cute baby sleeping with some puppies to cheer you up and get you back on track.

Awe :)

I am a first timer with any type of menstrual cup and I?m having a pretty hard time inserting it.. I?ve watched the tutorials and tried different folds but I?m finding it harder than I thought it would be. 

I want to be more eco-friendly and don?t want to use harmful tampons anymore. I purchased the slim fit cup with two flex discs as well. 
I need help to know if I input it correctly.. it?s my first day of my period and I have really bad cramps, and with this being my first time trying the cup, I?m not sure how it?s supposed to feel or how far in I?m supposed to put it in.

Any suggestions? I tried putting my finger around the cup to feel if it?s opened up all the way but my fingernails keep pinching and it hurts.

I am currently living on the island of Maui, but will be moving back to the mainland soon. I don't know my exact move date, it could be next week or in 2 months. My next box of FLEX is scheduled to ship on October 15th. Is there any way I can have that shipped now instead? I don't want to risk it going to the wrong address - I'd much rather have it in my possession before I have to move. I tried clicking around the site to ""change my order"" and ""manage my subscription"", but didn't see an option to speed up the shipping date.
Please let me know if this is possible, thanks!!

I've run in to two new discs that had a large hole and they were very different than the way the functional ones looked. They were both from the same box that I had just bought, and I was hoping if there was any way I could get any assistance?

"Aloha!

I received my trial box of flex today. Upon opening the white trial box (not the black outer shipping box) I found a swarm of live ants! I quickly tried to kill them all before they got on me/my bed. 
I have some photos of the squished ants in the box attached to this email. 

These flex discs are individually wrapped, but dont seem to be 100% airtight so I am concerned if any of the ants were able to get into the packages. 

If its possible to get another trial box, that would be great. I'll be leaving on a two-week trip on Thursday (11/7), so no rush to send this out.

Also, if my next shipment date could be moved from December to January, that would be great. Needless to say, this was upsetting, but I understand that ants can just get into things. 

My order number is #656433. Please let me know if any other information is needed.

I?ve been eagerly awaiting my latest Flex shipment, but it still has not arrived and today was the last day of my period. I know I get a two months supply, but is there anyways to change my shipment date so that it this doesn?t happen in a couple months?!

I have to say, it was a drag having to use tampons and I missed the convenience of Flex! Going to the bathroom is so much nicer with Flex, thank you for making that time of the month better!!

Your product sounds like a true winner.. I am concerned about the amount of disposable plastic this product will introduce into the environment.  Small items like this never break down and find their way into the oceans, and it?s not good for marine life.  If there is ever an update on a solution for this problem, I would purchase and also tell my friends.

Flex. I didn't have a hard time getting Flex in or out...actually getting it out was too easy and that's the problem. I'm not sure if the product is too long for me, but after inserting and making sure the end was tucked under my pelvic bone it felt fine. Then about 20 minutes later it felt weird. Inspected things and it had slid out. That dance continued for several tries - me pushing it back into place, it sliding out, me shoving my entire hand up there - just kidding, it wasn't that gruesome. It just won't stay!!!

I do know that my cervix tips backwards, so maybe that's why I can't seem to get it to stay put. Any pointers? I want it to work, but it's not looking good. 

Thanks!

Hi Arin, nice to meet you! I?m Kat, your designated Flexpert.

Things You Should Know About Me

1. I started my period during the first day of soccer tryouts in 7th grade.
2. I know all of the lines in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets movie.
3. I?ve been to the last 6 Dapper Days at Disneyland.

Why We Were Matched Up / My Period Profile

1. I used to wear tampons like clockwork. Running to the bathroom every 2 hours to change it and it was terrible! I was nervous about trying FLEX because I was worried it would hurt, but I was stunned and pleasantly surprised when I tried and could actually not feel FLEX.
2. I have a heavy-to-medium flow depending on the day of my cycle. I can tell when it?s coming since I?ll start eating all of the chocolate and happy-crying to videos of puppies and kids getting adopted.

My First Time Trying FLEX

I couldn't get insertion right, which was super frustrating! I tried different positions until I found one that worked for me (one leg up on the tub!). Once I got that down, it was smooth sailing! Now my period week is a breeze!

Want to chat about FLEX?  Or maybe just say hey? Ask me anything (nothing is TMI)!

Always here for you when you need me - even in the bathroom! :)

"Alright, sooi, I am having a problem with the soft discs. I have a feeling, they are not the same size as the flex. Everytime I feel like its in place, its not because when i sit and stand constantly it unhooks from the bone.. I go in with two fingers as well and still have the same issue. Now reading that you had to do a different position, I am going to try it.

"Alright. I received my first box and I?m about 3/5 of the way through my period. The first day was GREAT! I barely had a leak. But now! I insert it and I don?t have leaks until I start moving. The disk doesn?t seem to be staying put in one place. I gradually feel it coming into my canal though I?ve been placing it behind the pubic bone. Any tips. I hate pads and tampons so I really need this to work out  Also I was told once that I have a tilted pelvis...does that effect anything?

"Alright. So I?ve tried my flex a few times. The paranoia and anxiety I felt was literally unreal. The trust is just not there... I of course wore a hefty pad with it for back up, but I can?t get past the bathroom leaks. Even when I?m done using the restroom, I check to make sure it?s in the right spot. I do my thing, and then 5 minutes later I feel a gush. I don?t understand how people are able to wear JUST the flex and no pad! I want this shit locked and sealed up tight like a submarine filled with puppies going on a deep dive! 

I really want to be a fan, I hate pads, I hate periods, my best friend is getting married end of summer, I?m in the wedding and I?m going to be on my period! I literally told her ?idk, might not be able to make it if the flow ain?t right, sorry ????????.

I am the type of person that plans outfits and wears dark clothes when I?m on my period. Or, plans trips and activities around my cycle. I was super excited to try flex and get some freedom back but the leaks and the stress and paranoia is honestly just as bad....

1. The Office, and now the Office Ladies podcast. Netflix is removing it at the beginning of next year and I?m quite sure I?ll cancel my subscription because of it.
2. Libra? I think?
3. Last I knew he had a girlfriend. I have a friend of a friend who was her roommate a while back. So maybe there?s hope?

Homestretch of the monthly madness. It?s going okay, I?ve used more than one disc for two of the 6 12-hour days. I just kept getting spotting so I assumed I wasn?t getting it in the right spot. And I wasn?t sure if I could just dump it out and reuse it within that 12 hours? I?m getting the hang of keeping the mess off the toilet seat though! And it?s insanely comfortable! No more scratchy cotton stuff. When it?s positioned right I do have less cramps. Though I still get moody. Buuut I think it?s the lack of sleep from a 3 year old and twin 1-year olds? That?s what I tell myself anyway :)

I think the cup might be a good thing on heavier days. Does it work at night too?

"Alrighty,

I really want Flex to work. Because I hate tampons with a passion - both from a waste and inconvenience standpoint. But here's the thing - I have zero leaks when I'm sleeping/standing/sitting in a chair etc with Flex. I haven't been able to try working out yet just because of my schedule this week but I do have a concern with this:

When I sit on the floor with my toddler, it pretty much leaks consistently. Which, initially I thought was no big deal - I could wear a liner or period panty - except for my heaviest day, today, when I also bled through the liner during this particular leak. I would eventually want to stop wearing a liner or period panty with this product if I can get the fit right, but I do olympic weightlifting for my sport - so a lot of low squats. If it leaks with simply squatting to the floor with my daughter, I'm worried about trying to workout at all.

I'm not quite sure what else to try fit-wise. I have a fairly good grasp on anatomy - allied health professional - and I'm definitely getting it behind my pubic bone. Maybe I'm trying too hard and dislodging the seal on the back? I dunno. I'm feeling a little sad at this point. I'm loving pretty much everything else about the product - no leaks overnight/able to not worry about changing anything or making sure I have an hourly bathroom break in clinic, etc - but the random leaking with certain movements is leaving me a little lost as to what I'm doing wrong.

Hi Jessica, nice to meet you! I?m Natalie, your designated Flexpert.

Things You Should Know About Me

1. I was a super late bloomer and didn't get my period until I was 15!
2. Like 20% of women out there, I have a retroverted uterus. I guess my mom listened to way too much Fleetwood Mac while I was in the womb and my little uterus decided to go its own way.
3. I love adventure. I have scuba dived a shipwreck, ice climbed on a glacier and paraglided off the top of a mountain! 

Why We Were Matched Up / My Period Profile 

1. I never used anything but tampons before FLEX. Sitting around in a pad all day was never an option for me, and although I had heard of menstrual cups, I never bothered to try them or any other alternative period products because ""if it ain't broke, why fix it?"".
2. I have a light flow that is like clockwork thanks to my birth control pill. I have never let my period get in the way of living my life before, and FLEX has opened up a whole new realm of awesomeness in that regard.

My First Time Trying FLEX

I couldn't get it inserted quite right and ended up leaking and frustrated. I thought that, maybe because of my tilted uterus, I was going to be in that small percentage of menstruating humans that FLEX wasn't going to work for. I was super bummed, but even more determined! After some trial and error, I discovered that inserting FLEX while squatting was the perfect way for me to get it in at the right angle for my anatomy and pushed far enough back to completely cover my cervix. Now it works like a dream and I will never go back to using tampons.

Want to chat about FLEX? Or maybe just say hi? Ask me anything (nothing is TMI)!

Happy to be your girlfriend on the other side of the bathroom door!

Hi ,

I have exciting news. We are finally launching FLEX in the UK and I wanted you to be the first to know!

I realize that you signed up for a free sample last year only to be disappointed that we weren't quite ready to ship, and I'm sorry about that. We've since worked out the shipping kinks and want to make it up to you by offering you your first month ($USD 20) for FREE - just pay for shipping. 

You'll have full control over when and how often you get your next FLEX. And you can always live chat on our website (http://the-flex-company-1.trk.klaviyomail.com/wf/click?upn=q0FQm6c14XUyB1DG481CrBh3aD0hKCtVPnEx-2FCJDFS4xFVhxBPJGe-2FzChk02ROXtFFf9EcCqVW7E34jiUa0KaU0f-2FEmsdWWDX3D9XwjeuU9TwNkHI3J6L6vnI-2FamABZPXIxOKap9c31Ci8mNXbRp4tfn6SWYu0GrWWdZu-2BmgGsrd-2BQartpNR0Ewc8K3ktSTRFpqk-2FhEBUVVSaRR3-2BSzag2vl-2BRMyjIf8oCy0hXjDs-2F9QkSU64QY-2FWEFCUyvDtxjM_mjjdR9vRfBOky3J-2F9zUyUhfQNW2YE2SJPrTX2uNAF-2B0C-2FbjwJHLs-2BRMhQkRula9mnH1NBhtYpjskjQoA8HcwwIuNZnSubnnQ2BsAQ-2FtQGkaZXNPMEOp-2FEgFBxPzJzRJ-2Fhq12xcH-2F-2FLzWV1ZXeZkLJ3h8XXEJfzgFFNfSAiuTW1y4k4RXoBup4aGYbdiMjYrgy7fMpCuGRXq3OwWxmd5imK67oez9YOIVKwxtpVvrEzeoQmoiT2vvDFDiaXtO8RrBLTyJO0BW8153ykL2kz-2BSPl4wDZd1KzewEOO0nJqM9yZGQPbo8sEw5jwqKtvEMj2Z) or call us if you have any questions.

Hi,

 

FLEX transformed Danielle?s period, and it can transform yours too.

 

Let me tell you how much I love FLEX. It is so comfortable that I forget that I'm wearing it, and I don't really get cramps on my period anymore. I can (FINALLY) sleep through the night and not have to get up and change anything. I generally feel much better on my period, thank you so much for this!! ~ Danielle

 

I want you to experience the same freedom Danielle now feels, and I want to make it an easy decision for you.

 

Your offer to try 3 months of FLEX for only $15 + free shipping is ending shortly.

With FLEX you?ll have:

 

1.

12 hours of period protection: One disc lasts an average of 12 hours so you can stop carrying around a handful of tampons and pads for frequent trips to the bathroom.

2.

Less leaks: FLEX conforms to your shape of your body for a seal that is so comfortable you?ll forget you?re even on your period.

3.

Mess-free period sex: Because of where FLEX sits in the body you and your partner can enjoy sex on your period without the cleanup.

4.

Better sleep: Finally sleep soundly through accident-free nights, even on your heaviest days.

5.

A product made for your body: FLEX is not linked to TSS and is free of BPA, phthalates and natural rubber latex.?

 

Ready to transform your how you live life on your period?

 I saw that you left FLEX in
 your cart and I wanted to reach out to see if you had
 any questions.

 but it honestly changed my life.
 
 I promise it won't disappoint

"Am i able to return the box that just shipped to get my money back? I'm really upset that i didn't get any notification whatsoever that my next subscription box was about to be shipped and charged to my card. I have many subscriptions and have never had any of them just send it and charge my card without a heads up prior to shipping. This is the only reason i cancelled my subscription acct. We have hit some extremely tough financial times the last week and i really couldn't afford for the $28 to be pulled off my acct. Had it notified me, i would've just postponed delivery instead of cancelling. If there's anyway for me to get that amount refunded by returning the shipment or something, that would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

Hello Julia!

I?m Helena, your designated flexpert.

Why We Were Matched Up / My Period Profile
   
   - I used tampons before switching to FLEX, so I?ve been in your position and I get what it?s like to have to run to the bathroom every 4 hours.
   - I have a medium/average flow and my cycle is predictable unlike my love life.

Things You Should Know About Me
   
   - I started my period on my 14th birthday at a bowling alley party.
   - I do a pretty good Cher impersonation.
   - My favorite show is Jane the Virgin.ÿ

Want to chat about FLEX?ÿ Or maybe just say hey?

Ask me anything (nothing is TMI) and I?ll get back to you shortly. If you?re more of a texter, you can also reach me at (310) 773-4242. Can?t wait!

Proud to beÿhelping you from the other side of the bathroom,

I just got a box, very excited to give it a try, however I just want to make sure I'm not signed up for an automatic subscription (mainly because next month I'm having surgery and won't be able to put anything inside of my body for awhile). How do I check what the status is of my account and what I'm signed up for?

We are not here to tell you what to do.

We?re here to give you options. Making a choice doesn?t always mean making a commitment.

With FLEX you don?t have to have a subscription to experience our free delivery, 12-hour leak protection, and mess-free period sex.

You can order them once, twice, thrice, or at random. It?s up to you and with either option you get the same service.

Keeping your life free of subscriptions is cool but don?t miss out on your FLEX benefits.

Kind of like a friendly voice on the other side of the stall, they're here to answer questions, help guide you on your FLEX journey, and pass you a lil toilet paper if you need it. They?ll be reaching out to you personally in the next day or two.

Adjust, pause, ship now, or cancel anytime from your account page so you never run out of FLEX.

Not sure I?m doing the hands free emptying thing right. I kept bleeding through on my heavy day. When I?m on the toilet and I basically push to empty it, should I push the flex back into position with my finger? And is it suppose to be my finger or thumb? 
Thanks. Other than that, my cramps, which are seriously intense, were so much better with the flex! Noticed a HUGE difference, and can we talk about not having a pee string?!?! Uhh, brilliant!

Hi Elin,

I have exciting news. We are finally launching FLEX in the UK and I wanted 
you to be the first to know!

I realize that you signed up for a free sample last year only to be 
disappointed that we weren't quite ready to ship, and I'm sorry about that. 
We've since worked out the shipping kinks and want to make it up to you by 
offering you your first month ($USD 20) for FREE - just pay for shipping.

You'll have full control over when and how often you get your next FLEX.

Hi Shelly,

You wanted me to notify you once we had launched the menstrual disc in Canada and I?m happy to announce that our brand, Softcup, is now ready to ship to you.



Similar to FLEX, Softcup is a menstrual disc that is wearable up to 12 hours, and can be used for mess-free period sex. Softcup sits in the same place in the body around the cervix for a fit so comfortable you can?t even feel it.



You can now buy Softcup exclusively through Amazon.ca<http://the-flex-company-1.trk.klaviyomail.com/wf/click?upn=gE02jo8QEQs-2FEOLihAE5V5eB2AlDNAF7iZf3zQP56QaAZa8va3g2OjA4aWxaZazB2Zed7xCiYs3gR0K7t-2FB3geOH-2BrLaEyVPmN9KAVR-2Fx9IfdAmmrz5ei-2FPAoAhhozK4_na7mmnMYCPEQlNb6b5HYrTG5hMYNElouiQuEiGXUGwnpLUnL2qFHwB1yKV3fmguszCZ3g6uDtdOMLvnT2wyUuORov4Xrn7qgXhRbKwqYPfem8tfJfEMXCHLArwm7cYiH9UN0e51WEazghIUW6U-2Fyr2pfN1isnnHgYLxcgufvpDZSk4gtshelSK9lQCKHgbKlNS-2Bj9rW-2Bh7IDCkUodIqy-2F0M0ggov-2F6YUTt7QlnJI9m8Wpb3VETzWVpBssC7vpecwyRXIVm6eLJGlQRrT8gygwR1BP0qmspTa0uaeIZHNMzoqEOtokCY-2FzF3jx06DspVi48ksbkzk0eesNTionIAFniVZhbWIDl2gsO24IRwFpvvbd9XjIbyCVvIZ-2BUoKjmS8>.

Hi Lindsey! I?m Merissa, your designated Flexpert.

Why We Were Matched Up / My Period Profile

1. I used to use a menstrual cup, which gave me lots-o-extra time but ended up being painful and needy. FLEX gave me my life back without the hurt - I actually can?t feel it at all. 
2. I have a really heavy flow (I fill a super tampon in 1-3 hours) and cramps that felt like a mosh pit in my stomach.

Things You Should Know About Me

1. I started my period when I was 10 at a waterpark and was so confused! My mom wasn?t there and my dad got to handle it (like a champ, might I add).
2. I?m an avid runner and love being outside - movement is everything.
3. I grew up in a super small town. It has a population of just over 3,000, most of which are my family.

My First Time Trying FLEX

I tried FLEX on my heaviest day and found what looked like a war-zone in my chonies. Yes, leaks can happen while you're getting used to FLEX. But I?m now enjoying the most comfortable, leak-free period of my life! <3

   - I have a really heavy flow and pretty gnarly cramps. Most months it feels like my vagina/uterus betrayed me, but I power through it because I'm a badass and so are you.
   - My first crush ever was Bill Nye the Science Guy. (Still going strong btw... it's weird, I know, stop judging meÿplease.)

Things I'd love to know about you:
   
   - What's your go-to tv show or podcast?
   - What's your sign?
   - Do you know whether or not Bill Nye is single?



My First Time Trying FLEX

It was pretty easy, I was scared, but quickly realized that my biggest issue was that I was overthinking it. Once I relaxed and tried it a couple time, I got it to stay in the right spot. Now, I use my FLEX discs on my lighter days, and my Flex Cup on the heavier ones.

Using discs and the cup has completely changed my definition of what TMI means; I used to be very shy, and self-conscious about my body/period. But now, I will literally have a conversation about my vagina just as casually as I'd talk about my foot or arm. I've never felt more empowered to be myself.ÿ

Let me know if you have any questions about using your disc; I've heard it all! Or if you just want to say hello, that's okay too!

Since the FLexFit sits right close to my cervix and my vaginal tissues, I would like to have a bit more information about possible exposure to BPA and xenoestrogens.

Hey Rhiannon,

I'm your personal Flexpert, here to answer all of your questions about periods and period products. Let's chat about the struggles of having a heavy flow.

On average, we change our pads or tampons 5+ times per day, and can still leak. Here's what makes FLEX different.

FLEX discs can hold up to five tampons' worth of fluid. Even on my heaviest days, I now only have to change my disc every 12 hours. Believe me, I was super skeptical before I tried.

And the best part? Leaking is a thing of the past. The ComfortSeal? design forms to the shape of our bodies to create a leak-proof seal. Crazy, right?

Try FLEX now (https://trk.klclick2.com/wf/click?upn=gE02jo8QEQs-2FEOLihAE5V53Bckb9X6T9gnyvtGZLgYPQ8ydCbzfnMWgcOWFW3OEia7wxEcmJ9Qr0ojZEcgU15sIOGv4C168Mrpx8kNTOGksPvXHGIwG4vNrV-2BSbyTQuogRK4q6IAFN9QAk6v-2FeQd45QsHEmz3mMsi74-2BGBMx558QFf0DDBFql89lZ1EMyIrwwMgb5B-2F512m-2Bv5w7kZfSJxHi6rTPajWccGGP6N1vXPjBjQmbQuvCTCeDxagIl0EFmcmf9-2BilZQwb3u1-2FCzs3s0-2BJC2RrSM-2FmtOChJ-2B5GIm6Xgr-2Fc3qLjv6BXEwZSO7HJFlWq3-2F2uNm9wlqNjorb12gA4eak1hJOjWbXtdJH41i3Rd-2Bi-2F0cZp0icQjPn12-2BxbsMiKdhmmoL1gf4-2FSY15FUA-3D-3D_0qaula1ID-2FAHjddZqd3BBE1ufL7I7-2FXHFICyDmeMZBNyPp8YeIkLW7G03-2BTOufb9U64QhA7-2FSDSErVOXfcqLMQ8vHP5te4-2BYBJza8WyW0t2fa6tUMbzUz7TOnXOLHk7CQkTBeF8pwJXpRT89zK0aqaxhslJMhRvWcFDYUHDwZYnrqtsiih-2FfBDU0ZMEYsg3I6-2B40CXVEorAn-2FHFGuuijmqBRlrd1pRxNkKkogWa5GUHCAwuDxg0qDvewDWU9-2Fw3MHMmx8WdPHkM8IkTsCe0P-2BiJ68LVV6EBWbFXZbhEY2YhfqhoeNI0zJ5rVSQvqMabOrzolCFL7CRfjsYs6UjttsFa3ofOKDJKOCoObRJxWlEijxrT-2BHwpjMBY4FgppRgJ-2FOsBq0slNYDV8gxXp7Sli7Q-3D-3D) to experience the difference for yourself.

Hi Abigail! I?m Merissa, your designated Flexpert.

Why We Were Matched Up / My Period Profile

1. I used to use a menstrual cup, which gave me lots-o-extra time but ended up being painful and needy. FLEX gave me my life back without the hurt - I actually can?t feel it at all. 
2. I have a really heavy flow (I fill a super tampon in 1-3 hours) and cramps that felt like a mosh pit in my stomach.

Things You Should Know About Me

1. I started my period when I was 10 at a waterpark and was so confused! My mom wasn?t there and my dad got to handle it (like a champ, might I add).
2. I?m an avid runner and love being outside - movement is everything.
3. I grew up in a super small town. It has a population of just over 3,000, most of which are my family.

My First Time Trying FLEX

I tried FLEX on my heaviest day and found what looked like a war-zone in my chonies. Yes, leaks can happen while you're getting used to FLEX. But I?m now enjoying the most comfortable, leak-free period of my life! <3

Hi there,

Lauren and I have officially been shipping FLEX for a year and a half (time flies when you?re having fun, huh?) and the feedback from our customers has been incredible.

""I will never go back to tampons, EVER!"" - Alesha

We recently started selling a biodegradable, body-safe pouch to make it easier to remove FLEX without any mess.

Hi Angela,

We?ve got some great news and some not so great news.

The great news is that there are thousands of people like you using FLEX as their primary period product! The not so great news is that we didn?t expect to be this popular and we?re experiencing slight delays in shipping.

We are doing everything we can to get you FLEX as soon as possible so you can have it when you need it. We?ve expedited your shipment so it will ship by the beginning of next week and reach you by the end of next week. If your cycle is coming up sooner, just reply to this email and let us know. We?ll do our best to help you out.

To thank you for your patience, we are adding a $5 credit to your account that will be applied to your next order of FLEX.

Thanks,

The Flex Team",50104

""These have been the answer to all of my period problems. No more pee string, no more accidentally flushing tampons, no more strange chemicals in my sanitary items.""
Felicia

""The true test came on my heavy day and I didn't leak!!! I can't feel it at all and go on with life as usual. I changed my flex at 6 AM and 6 PM. So awesome not having to be out and search for a restroom bc I feel ""gross?.""
Brittany

""These things are a game changer! Super simple to put in. Taking out was simple as well. To be able to go 12 hours on my heaviest days with zero leaks - simply amazing! No more stressing about back to back meetings, beach days, workouts, nothing!""

I thought I had cancelled it since it seems that carrying 10 pound babies makes your bladder move south and literally ejects those discs after like 10 steps. It?s almost a hazard how fast they just come out on their own. Is there a way to cancel the order?? I?m also moving in like 5 days (military orders) and will likely not be here when they arrive.

"Appreciate it! But I am sticking with my old cup.
I am not sure but I felt like it leaked because it was never tucked securely under the pelvic bone, it was always open from one side however farther down I push it. Not sure ..maybe it?s too big for me. :( I was very comfortable wearing this but paranoid of leakages. May be you consider making smaller size discs if that makes sense.

Hey there, My name is Andrea, I am 35 years old, a wife and a proud mother of two beautiful children. My son is four and my daughter just turned two, both were born at a hefty 9 pounds 4 ounces, leaving me with an incredibly weak pelvic floor. Since the birth of my children I have struggled with the inability to wear tampons, they would actually fall out so often that I was stuck with having to wear pads. At two years postpartum I am just now ?able? to use tampons again, however leaks are a constant experience and forget wearing a tampon swimming, it falls out within minutes. My kids love swimming and I hate when I have to tell them no just because I?m on my period. As a retired ballerina, I have continued my career with teaching rising young dancers. I also highly enjoy my ?me time? weightlifting at the gym. Unfortunately, my period has become extremely irritating and inhibits my ability to do the things I enjoy most, even playing with my kids!  Something as simple as a sneeze would dislodge a tampon, much less a squat, deadlift or bench press. When I first saw an ad for the Flex Disc, I was super skeptical, but I figured anything was better than what I was doing. I was wrong, Flex disc isn?t just ?better,? it?s magical! After day two of my period I was already figuring out how to really use the disc. It?s amazing how simple and easy a period can be with the Flex disc. To add to the simplicity of it all, I experienced highly reduced cramps. In the past I have been in so much pain I?ve fainted, but not anymore! My last period I could barely feel my cramps. I have been so excited about this product that I can hardly restrain myself from telling every woman I know and even women I don?t know! I fully endorse the Flex disc. I cannot imagine going back to irritating, painful, leaking, periods and tampons that literally fall out of my vagina. The Flex disc is the most amazing period product I have ever encountered. Thank you all for the research, time and care you have taken to develop this incredible product! If there is anyway I can help promote the Flex disc and the Flex Fit company I am happy to help.
Newly proud and confident about being a woman on her period, 
Andrea Snider
ps, my husband and I are actually looking forward to giving the disc the sex test!

I ran across your company last year and again today as part of my daily routine  -- namely, scouring the oceans of startups out there as a public relations pro -- and you guys piqued my interest.


To make it brief, I?m dropping you a line because you guys look like a perfect fit for our agency, Pop Culture PR. I would love to speak with you as soon as time permits.


Based in Los Angeles, the staffers here at Pop Culture PR are talking to journalists, news editors, and television producers every day who I?m sure would be interested in what you guys are doing. But, most importantly, these are not paid-for media opportunities - these are mainstream, organic media opportunities with journalists that have a genuine interest in what you and your company are doing, unlike ineffective and costly ?advertorials? or press release services.



Would you be interested in receiving feature press coverage from some of the most influential media in the United States and globally? Getting in front of millions of readers and viewers? That?s what we have been making happen for our clients every day for the last 25 years, and we?re confident we can do the same for you.


I?ve personally helped companies just like yours bring their products to market by putting them in front of the world?s most influential journalists and media outlets - since 1997. And, after a quick review, it seems to be a strong fit.

Check out these 21 examples and I think you'll be impressed:
www.popculturepr.com/case-studies<http://www.popculturepr.com/case-studies>


Are you able to speak sometime this week? Please use this link to schedule something with me directly here ? https://calendly.com/popculturepr/free-evaluation-x



Please advise.

"Are all discs made the same? I tried the flex version while it came in the box with the up I purchased at Target. I loved it and got online to order more. An ad must have popped up first because when I received ""softdiscs"" (pink flex ring) which is a registered trademark of flex. I thought I was ordering flex brand (black flex ring). I had trouble with this brand feeling like it slid back further than the flex and had major leakage. Like a middle school girl leakage. Very embarrassed at a church picnic! Just curious, I ordered a new box from flex website today and fingers crossed it fits better.

Thank you!

Hey Sahira,

I'm your personal Flexpert, here to answer all of your questions about periods and period products. Let's chat about the struggles of having a heavy flow.

On average, we change our pads or tampons 5+ times per day, and can still leak. Here's what makes FLEX different.

FLEX discs can hold up to five tampons' worth of fluid. Even on my heaviest days, I now only have to change my disc every 12 hours. Believe me, I was super skeptical before I tried.

And the best part? Leaking is a thing of the past. The ComfortSeal? design forms to the shape of our bodies to create a leak-proof seal. Crazy, right?

Try FLEX now (http://trk.klclick.com/wf/click?upn=gE02jo8QEQs-2FEOLihAE5V53Bckb9X6T9gnyvtGZLgYPQ8ydCbzfnMWgcOWFW3OEiBifYxQfzDFsgxDdTVp7YLasHqlm6iWfraH2rDFOtIQGtvzrSOUlTe1bf-2FfrsUqZRdrsYODzo1XqLovh61GI7h6Y88EYK-2FemOUX4Psshf0-2FzqaD-2BzGFq3Qq6YXiUIOwU74gRgVvodh8BFN6Z8aJOXACZH6LHCyOA2Ox6YC-2B2rYndT9vdXbkpeYd3CkOWynHaJnK5J7YL6BMbvsxvl089pAyeELH-2BfEWR-2BSRTTF2CmHQCXLtJ-2BVpoIaRhZyV7v3yqn-2FJJ80SGkKtyWsCzpCmCRhblFrEJlpBlG9w8GZfKRgL4-3D_FETNYUGTI7r7hAZT4RDcbv6b1aIz6u0wHO17v-2F4GKl7HoeJQRM9Let-2FcbrK6bKuM1NdBMYl3sO69-2BHvXmCPStiGRy-2B2nTBk-2BVeCjBo375yLjlMQ8vSQjSZZncghKJ-2FgIs4oaYPObBZIkZKfQWlejRThToSvhQp1bZeJhi3-2FcPxcJfg3QiOR2DkjoPqFfjFWmuUH-2FWrknpJc0AQLwdaDGeVN-2Ft3eMtrZIA7CXU-2B4B0X1MowB2UetiJPR-2BZUr56oPgBKDcBn1HdFN7Ux6HXkvoRKbtt1ZSfmco6UqrIKPE-2BHHXelxU8pRSvp-2FIUaIIBiF9tuzYu3Ua50q5pkW52PyiFacWtp7AIbt0IXTetz3IuTNAF4aCnTvviogQeku7T5gPuDEgYvge6zHBOrCHNsvFGw-3D-3D) to experience the difference for yourself.

Hi Monalisa,

I?m Zori, your designated Flexpert!

Things You Should Know About Me

1. There's nothing I love more than parmesan cheese.
2. I got my first period when I was 11. I thought I was prepared for it until it actually happened?I think I cried for about 2 whole hours; the hormones combined with the idea I'd have to deal with blood coming out of an area that was extremely confusing to me at the time for basically the rest of my life freaked me out. Can you tell I was a dramatic kid? 
3. I have a really heavy flow and pretty gnarly cramps. Most months it feels like my vagina/uterus betrayed me, but I power through it because I'm a badass and so are you.
4. My first crush ever was Bill Nye the Science Guy. (Still going strong btw... it's weird, I know, stop judging me please.)

Things I'd love to know about you:

1. What's your go-to tv show or podcast?
2. What's your sign?
3. Do you know whether or not Bill Nye is single?

My First Time Trying FLEX

It was pretty easy, I was scared, but quickly realized that my biggest issue was that I was overthinking it. Once I relaxed and tried it a couple time, I got it to stay in the right spot. Now, I use my FLEX discs on my lighter days, and my Flex Cup on the heavier ones.

Using discs and the cup has completely changed my definition of what TMI means; I used to be very shy, and self-conscious about my body/period. But now, I will literally have a conversation about my vagina just as casually as I'd talk about my foot or arm. I've never felt more empowered to be myself. 

Let me know if you have any questions about using your disc; I've heard it all! Or if you just want to say hello, that's okay too!

Hello Heather,

I'm Helena, your designated Flexpert.

Trying FLEX can seem daunting, even a little intimidating at first. But I wanted to let you know that you're not alone. I've been there and use FLEX myself so please consider me a guide through the trial process.

A little about me...

1. My friends and family live for my character impressions - from Cher, to Julia Childs, to Lois from Family Guy.
2. I'm addicted to true crime everything - books, podcasts, shows. Not on my watch! ;)
3. On a Friday night, you'll find me having a glass of wine, binging one of my fave shows, and snuggling with my sweet pup, Willie.

My Period Profile

1. I started my period on my 14th birthday at a bowling alley party.
2. I've tried pads, tampons, period panties, cups. I've done it all!
3. I have a medium flow and my cycle is predictable - unlike my love life.

My First Time Trying Flex

I was really nervous and had to take a few deep breaths, but it was way easier than I thought it would be. Now, my first removal was another story. A comical disaster, but lesson learned. Pee before you remove is all I'll say. ;)

Want to chat about FLEX? Or maybe just say hey? Ask me anything - I've heard it all (nothing is TMI).

xx

Pinch

FLEX may look big but it's actually smaller than a tampon when you insert it. Start by washing your hands and pinching it in half.

Insert

Sit on the toilet and slide into the vaginal canal, pushing back and down as far as it will comfortably go (typically the length of your index finger).

Use your finger to tuck the front edge up behind your pubic bone so the disc rests slightly diagonally. This will create a seal at the base of your cervix.

If you are having a tough time inserting FLEX, try a different position. We recommend squatting or putting one foot on the tub.

Still have some questions on insertion?

Wear

While you?re learning how to use FLEX, we recommend using pads or liners for peace of mind. Once you get placement right, you won?t need them anymore.

Only 36% of women get placement right on the first try. Stick with it.

Remove

Wash your hands and sit on the toilet. Hook your finger under the front edge of the disc and pull straight out, keeping FLEX parallel to the floor.

 

Place FLEX back in the wrapper and toss it in the trash.

 

How to avoid a messy removal?

With practice,  you should be able to remove FLEX over the toilet without a mess. On heavy days, we recommend taking it out in the shower.

Hi,
 

I?m Erika, cofounder of The Flex Company - nice to e-meet you! I hope your Wednesday is going well.
 

I don?t usually do this but I peeked at your answers to our quiz and it looks like constantly having to change your tampon or pad during your period (day or night) is a key reason you are looking for an alternative to traditional period products.

 

As you know, changing your tampon or pad every 3 to 4 hours is highly disruptive to your daily schedule ? especially on your heavier flow days. What?s even more frustrating is when you can?t get a good night?s rest for the same reason.
 

One of FLEX?s most appreciated benefits is its 12 hour wear. Not only does FLEX allow you to go through your day with less interruption, but it also allows you to sleep through the night without worry.
 

How would your life be different if you could change your period product no more than 3 times per day?
 

I?d love to get a box out to you so you can try it for yourself.

Hello Jennifer,

I'm Helena, your designated Flexpert.

Trying FLEX can seem daunting, even a little intimidating at first. But I wanted to let you know that you're not alone. I've been there and use FLEX myself so please consider me a guide through the trial process.

A little about me...

1. My friends and family live for my character impressions - from Cher, to Julia Childs, to Lois from Family Guy.
2. I'm addicted to true crime everything - books, podcasts, shows. Not on my watch! ;)
3. On a Friday night, you'll find me having a glass of wine, binging one of my fave shows, and snuggling with my sweet pup, Willie.

My Period Profile

1. I started my period on my 14th birthday at a bowling alley party.
2. I've tried pads, tampons, period panties, cups. I've done it all!
3. I have a medium flow and my cycle is predictable - unlike my love life.

My First Time Trying Flex

I was really nervous and had to take a few deep breaths, but it was way easier than I thought it would be. Now, my first removal was another story. A comical disaster, but lesson learned. Pee before you remove is all I'll say. ;)

Want to chat about FLEX? Or maybe just say hey? Ask me anything - I've heard it all (nothing is TMI).

xx

1 FLEX disc holds 3 super tampons' worth of fluid. That means less waste going to landfills.

 

On top of that, you'll have less stuff to carry around, make fewer trips to the bathroom, and won't interrupt your workout routine.

Hey there,

I was pretty skeptical when Lauren gave me my first FLEX (I was a lifelong tampon user) but it honestly changed my life.

I promise it won't disappoint and I can't wait to hear what you think!

Hello Ashley,

I'm Helena, your designated Flexpert.

Trying FLEX can seem daunting, even a little intimidating at first. But I wanted to let you know that you're not alone. I've been there and use FLEX myself so please consider me a guide through the trial process.

A little about me...

1. My friends and family live for my character impressions - from Cher, to Julia Childs, to Lois from Family Guy.
2. I'm addicted to true crime everything - books, podcasts, shows. Not on my watch! ;)
3. On a Friday night, you'll find me having a glass of wine, binging one of my fave shows, and snuggling with my sweet pup, Willie.

My Period Profile

1. I started my period on my 14th birthday at a bowling alley party.
2. I've tried pads, tampons, period panties, cups. I've done it all!
3. I have a medium flow and my cycle is predictable - unlike my love life.

My First Time Trying Flex

I was really nervous and had to take a few deep breaths, but it was way easier than I thought it would be. Now, my first removal was another story. A comical disaster, but lesson learned. Pee before you remove is all I'll say. ;)

Want to chat about FLEX? Or maybe just say hey? Ask me anything - I've heard it all (nothing is TMI).

xx

Helena

Hi Jessika,

I?m Zori, your designated Flexpert!

Things You Should Know About Me

1. There's nothing I love more than parmesan cheese.
2. I got my first period when I was 11. I thought I was prepared for it until it actually happened?I think I cried for about 2 whole hours; the hormones combined with the idea I'd have to deal with blood coming out of an area that was extremely confusing to me at the time for basically the rest of my life freaked me out. Can you tell I was a dramatic kid? 
3. I have a really heavy flow and pretty gnarly cramps. Most months it feels like my vagina/uterus betrayed me, but I power through it because I'm a badass and so are you.
4. My first crush ever was Bill Nye the Science Guy. (Still going strong btw... it's weird, I know, stop judging me please.)

Things I'd love to know about you:

1. What's your go-to tv show or podcast?
2. What's your sign?
3. Do you know whether or not Bill Nye is single?

My First Time Trying FLEX

It was pretty easy, I was scared, but quickly realized that my biggest issue was that I was overthinking it. Once I relaxed and tried it a couple time, I got it to stay in the right spot. Now, I use my FLEX discs on my lighter days, and my Flex Cup on the heavier ones.

Using discs and the cup has completely changed my definition of what TMI means; I used to be very shy, and self-conscious about my body/period. But now, I will literally have a conversation about my vagina just as casually as I'd talk about my foot or arm. I've never felt more empowered to be myself. 

Let me know if you have any questions about using your disc; I've heard it all! Or if you just want to say hello, that's okay too!

Hi Amy!

I?m Kat, your designated Flexpert.

Why We Were Matched Up / My Period Profile

  1.  I used to wear pads like a baby in diapers - happy but not in control of what was happening around me. I wore pads because I don?t care what they say - I can always feel tampons! I was stunned and pleasantly surprised when I tried and could actually not feel FLEX.
  2.  I have a light-to-medium flow depending on the day of my cycle. I can tell when it?s coming since I?ll start eating all of the chocolate and happy-crying to videos of puppies and kids getting adopted.

"Are you going to make a reasonable flex disc and if no why not? I really like the concept of the disc but the whole reason I'm thinking of going this route is convenience and tbt I haven't been able to get the products my daughter and I use in the stores and 2nd reason is this seems easier, cheaper and more environment friendlier plus we're planning on a long hike to the woods where bathrooms are scarce and these seem pack friendly as well instead of a extra bag just for pads and tampons. If you've not thought about it which I find highly doubtful please, please, consider it! Could you let me know if you have such an item or why you haven't made it in reusable form.

Thus, an important part of your PR strategy does not apply to European users.  So it's simply annoying to read or hear that this is more affordable than, let's say, a cup. It is certainly not.

Are you serious with what this female says in the first 2 seconds of your ad? I know you have to have a sale gimmick but can we keep it clean for our youth? This is quite disgusting. The ad is very offensive. I would be happy to try a product from you but this ad is turning me away as I am sure it will many people.,332151

"Are you struggling to grow your Instagram? Or even worse, posting daily and then content number is more than followers?

The months of selecting content, creating content and posting it is just ruined because you have very less engagement again. And now you don't want to ever looked on Instagram.

In my career I have seen that not growing Instagram is one of the hardest things that people go through (until they use my system) and this leads to sluggish growth of brand, no lead generation and zero profit of using Instagram and eventually ruining the whole life and the zeal to fly and prosper. 

There is only one and only one solution to this whole problem it's called optimisation method. This method got one of my client 3 customers on first day, 10k followers to other, 1070% visibility to other and 64.7k  views to another. (https://app.sales.rocks/linkClicked/89784b9e065330bfc4182078d40c4ed1)

So basically what you need to do is :

1.
Optimise your bio and username with keywords of your niche 
2.
upload high quality and engaging content. 
3.
Focus more on Reels


Now writing this whole method and explaining it on the mail would take me yeeeeeaaaaaaaaarrrrrrs.

So what I have is a consultation call for you (only four Free spots) in which I will exactly understand the problem you are having and share you the exact system behind optimisation method so that you get better visibility.

You ship these large boxes with unnecessary frilly bits and an unwanted or needed ""magazine"", and your rather adorable little product package is made superfluous with foil embossing. Why spend here?? Just get your already great product out to ladies who want it for as little cost to them as reasonable profit margin will allow. Reduce waste, be more environmentally friendly.

"As a long distance runner I am SO thankful to have found Flex! I can?t tell you how many 100 mile runs or long adventures I?ve been out on, hours away from supplies, running water, let alone the privacy of a bathroom having to change and carry out tampons. Blah.  It was just what had to be done to continue living the life that I love and speaks to me. Now, with Flex, those same adventures feel even more doable and with less stress, cramps and mess. I?m speaking up only after one cycle experience with Flex, but even in one cycle I feel so many potential benefits. I?m moving into my van next month and imagine Flex will make my next cycle easier to manage while living on the move. I?ve already been chatting about it on runs with my girlfriends and there is curiosity in their response. I know I?ll have a better understanding and easier explanation as I move through the coming months.

As an athlete and ambassador for running and natural spaces I am wondering if someone can speak to the materials used to make this awesome product, how they break down over time, and the impact on the environment. 

One last thought, one I?m rather excited about :), I would love to collaborate with Flex to help all athletes that have to deal with a menstral cycle experience the many benefits I am already seeing from Flex.

"As a marketer, I have to share this story. I'm 44, and have a group chat with my college BFFs. Most of us have noticed that in our 40s our periods are WAY worse, and my one friend Mere texted that we had to try Flex. Mere is a yoga teaching, naturalist mom of 2. She is  also  a triathlete. So I thought - just because she thinks this  is great doesn't mean I will. Next, Anne Genevieve- no kids, living her best life- tried and and texted ""Flex had changed my life."" 

I thought, ok fine I'll bite. I got Flex and just tried it for the first time. No tampons,  can't feel anything, no cramps (!!!), no heating pads. I just texted them last night: no sh*t, this is life changing!

Now I'm preaching to my work ladies about it! I said: you may be scared. You may think it won't fit. Or it will get lost. IT WON'T, it's awesome, it's SO EASY, and get it now, thank me later.

That's all!

Being a man, I asked my wife to read the website too! Let me start by congratulating you on researching, designing, developing and launching what seems to be an incredible, unique and attractive new product that could take the world by storm!
We live here in Denmark in Europe and would be grateful to have a conversation with the most suitable member of staff at Flex as we would be very interested in marketing and selling the product in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Having discussed the product with each other at length, we sincerely believe in its potential.
I would appreciate it if you could have a look at my LinkedIn profile - https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulchaggar which should provide you with the level of comfort of dealing with a senior commercial professional specialised in building profitable, sustainable, and professional brands globally.

"As a vital member of the natural products industry, I am requesting you contact your Representatives and tell them to support the amendment to modify the House Agriculture appropriations bill to that appropriate critical funds to undertake the appropriate processes and set a safe level of CBD for consumers to use each day. As the leading association for dietary supplements, natural health & sports nutrition, medical & functional foods, probiotics, and natural personal/home care products, the Natural Products Association has led the fight against the FDA?s inaction and demanded a standard by which all CBD products are held.
ÿ
As long-time advocates for commonsense practices relating to cannabidiol (CBD) usage, the Natural Products Association (NPA) is seeking help from Congress to encourage the Federal Drug Administration to establish safe use level for dietary supplement and conventional food CBD products.ÿ
ÿ
With over 1,500 CBD products in the marketplace, consumers have a right to know whether the products they are consuming are safe. This fundamental language would provide companies making and selling CBD products the regulatory clarity they need and consumers the assurance that they deserve that the products they are buying meet federal safety standards.

"As a women and a mother of 3 girls I find your ad of a women talking about her period and how she likes having sex and how she uses tampons gross and repulsive. Yes I think we need to be more comfortable with our bodies and being able to talk to the doctors or even other women about them. HOWEVER I dont want to be thought of as a sex driven dripping with blood creature. I want to be thought of as an lady. Clean and kind and nice to be around. In the same way I wish my husband kept it to himself when he has a bowel movement. Some things still need to be private. We are not animals we are people. We do not need to act like this we need to act better. Women need to set the example and act with dignity and grace. We need to behave in a manner of professional nature. Think about how made we all got when it came out about trump talking about grabbing women by the pussy..... so we make a commercial about our bleeding pussy and expect men to treat us better. We need to act better and not make our body out to be a joke. Maybe then we will start to get the respect we deserve. Maybe then they can see us as valuable members of society and not just our pussy. I expect people making ads with all their education to come up with better ads to help our young girls see what precious people they are. I expect you to present women as smart individuals who are not animals who just want sex. I expect you to help women to be empowered by your products helping them to reach their goals and help them not be held back by the monthly visitor. I also expect this because I want my son to not think this women who talks like a man who just took a shit is normal. I want the human race to climb higher then being driven by sex during a period. I think you can make an ad to do that. I think you can find a classy way to portray women. I think you can help us rise to be better. I think you have the power. Let's see some better commercials PLEASE.

As I hit submit payment I forgot to double check that it was the regular flex and not the slim size.  Is there a way to change that before it ships?,207915

Hi Page,

I hope your Monday is going well!

I noticed it?s been about a week since my previous email, and I just wanted to follow up with you. No matter your reason for cancelling, I?d love to find a way for you to truly experience why our most common member review is ?I forgot I was on my period.?

If I can help you through it this time, would you be willing to give it another shot? Just reply with Y for yes or N for no and I can help reactivate your membership.

Let?s do this!

as i was trying to use the disc for the first time overnight i would insert it to the point where my fingers were as far as they could go to make sure i got it up far enough and as i would sleep (maybe 30 minutes at a time) it would quite literally fall out. i use light tampons because regular tampons are too painful so to have this fall out 4 times throughout the night was disappointing. i?ve gotten no sleep because everytime i fall asleep i?m woken up by it falling out. i?ve tried multiple ways to get it in and don?t know what i?m doing wrong. i?m pretty upset by this experience ,201377
"As I'm reading the facts about FLEX my mouth dropped more and more as I clicked next on each article.

Personally I use an IUD as a form of birth control and unfortunately with this there's consistent enough bleeding. This of course normal for the first few (very long) months. Some days are better than others but it feels AMAZING knowing that this product exists to be able to make me feel comfortable in my own skin again.

This is something I would place on the website as well. There are women who are in the same position I am where it's a period causing havoc but birth control. I'm looking forward to using this product.

"As much as I enjoy your product. I?m not using nearly as many as I thought I would, and for the moment I would like to cancel my subscription.  I will consider renewing in a few months if and when I eventually run out. This is important because I am now completely self-employed and I need to cut back on every subscription for the time being.  I can?t have things automatically coming out of my account unless it is absolutely necessary and since I now have a plethora of your product I really need to not have any more stacked up in my closet.

"As much as I would love to try it I simply don't have the money right now. My 8 year old son had to go to the ER on Monday and then they ended up transferring him to the specialty Children's hospital over an hour away. He was there for 2 days. What spare money we had I ended up using while I was there. We are now going to have 2 hospital bills on top of an ambulance transport bill to be paying very soon. Not to mention all the doctor bills from the follow up appointments.

"As someone who has a hate love relationship with tampons I am always on the lookout for something different. I saw flex and it looks good but as always I'm worried about the same thing, the hate part of my tampon relationship: application and removal. As I have a light period so don't need heavy duty and can survive on just 2 pads a day and one at night (vice versa with tampons). However I love movement which is very difficult with pads and can often end up with tangles and hair rip outs. But tampons leave me with long lasting dryness and pain as I can't always guarantee that it's going to be wet enough for a semi-comfortable removal which almost always means I end up with a pretty close to dry tampon experience every time. Because of this I pretty much ban all activities that require tampons and so dread my time of the month. I was wondering if flex is just going to be a repeat of the uncomfortable and painful experience of applying and removing tampons, because as someone lazy and inexperienced no matter how good it is once it's in if the start and finish are still horrible than it's more trouble than it's worth for me.

"As strange as it is to have a discussion about this, I actually am glad they set this up and I do have a few questions. I am trying it for the first time, actually more close to the truth, I tried it yesterday and it was a mess. So I am using tampons today. 
I don't think I got it far enough in, and don't think I had it sitting right. I still couldn't feel it like the package said I shouldn't, but it didn't work, leaked out and taking it out was super gross. I saw the pamphlet for how to insert it, but I don't think I am able to get it that far in.

Hello Jennifer,

I'm Helena, your designated Flexpert.

Why We Were Matched Up / My Period Profile

1. I used tampons before switching to FLEX, so I've been in your position and I get what it's like to have to run to the bathroom every 4 hours.
2. I have a medium/average flow and my cycle is predictable unlike my love life.

Things You Should Know About Me

1. I started on my period on my 14th birthday at a bowling alley party.
2. I do a pretty good Cher impersonation.
3. My favorite show is Jane the Virgin.

My First Time Trying Flex

I was really nervous the first time and had to take a few deep breaths, but it was really easy! Now, my first removal was another story. A comical disaster, but lesson learned. Pee before you remove is all I'll say. ;)

Want to chat about FLEX? Or maybe just say hey?

Ask me anything (nothing is TMI) and I'll get back to you shortly. If you're more of a texter, you can also reach me at (310) 773-4242. Can't wait!

Happy to be helping you from the other side of the bathroom,

Helena

Does this mean I just don't have it positioned correctly to start with?

Hi there,

I wanted to share a special offer for loyal FLEX customers. For a limited time, you can get a subscription upgrade and save $16 on your next order.

Here?s how it works: Moving forward, we?ll send you a 3-month supply of FLEX (24 discs for $29) instead of a one-month supply (8 discs for $15). That?s the same number of discs for $16 less. 

By shipping every three months, we can cut down waste over 60% and save on shipping costs, which means we can pass those savings along to you. As always, shipping is included and you can skip, adjust your frequency, or cancel anytime.

Just reply ?Y? for yes to this email, and I?ll apply the $16 discount for all of your upcoming orders.

Cheers,

"At this point in my life I?m under a lot of stress for various reasons, and my period being one of the main things. I?ve been bleeding for the last three weeks because of an offset with my BC, and i was hoping that flex would be my saving grace to help me get through this and maybe forget i was bleeding. However this has not been the case this for around. Two weeks ago when i used my cup last, i had a pretty good week. I had finally got my leakage to be very minimal and i thought i had found the right product for me after trying both the disc and cup. This go around with using the cup, I?m constantly spotting  and it?s very heavy! I?m soiling two thick panty lines every two hours. I noticed that when I?m leaking my cup has moved up higher in my vagina. I can tell that the cup is open but it kinda gets lost up and to the side and think this is allowing the blood to come out. What can i do to keep it in place? I don?t wanna give up on flex but I am tired. I?m tired of the uncertainty. I?ve messed up like 5 pair of underwear this week, and completely bled through a pair of my work pants. What can i do? What?s wrong with me? It seems like I?m the only one who?s having this issue. I?ve been reading post from the group and most of them are successful with flex. I can?t go back to pads and tampons because they cause too many infections but now i despise using the bathroom because of all the mess i have to deal with.

Hi Sherrell,

Just checking in again quickly because you?ve been a FLEX subscriber for a few months and I want to offer you your subscription at $15/month instead of $20/month.

We'll upgrade your order so you'll get a 24 pack of FLEX shipped every 3 months ($45 charged quarterly) instead of an 8 pack shipped every month ($20 charged monthly). As always shipping is free and you can skip, adjust your frequency, or cancel at anytime.

Can I upgrade your order and knock $5/month off your FLEX subscription? Reply Y for yes or N for no and I?ll take care of the rest.

"At what age do you think is a good time to introduce flex? My daughter is 10 and started at 9. She has pretty bad periods as well to the point she is more comfortable wearing depends rather than pads. Her doctor just put on birth control to help her flow.Sent from my Samsung Galaxy smartphone.

Things You Should Know About Me


	I started my period during the first day of soccer tryouts in 7th grade.
	I know all of the lines in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets movie.
	I?ve been to the last 6 Dapper Days at Disneyland.


Why We Were Matched Up / My Period Profile


	I used to wear tampons like clockwork. Running to the bathroom every 2 hours to change it and it was terrible! I was nervous about trying FLEX because I was worried it would hurt, but I was stunned and pleasantly surprised when I tried and could actually not feel FLEX. 
	I have a heavy-to-medium flow depending on the day of my cycle. I can tell when it?s coming since I?ll start eating all of the chocolate and happy-crying to videos of puppies and kids getting adopted.


My First Time Trying FLEX

I couldn't get insertion right, which was super frustrating! I tried different positions until I found one that worked for me (one leg up on the tub!). Once I got that down, it was smooth sailing! Now my period week is a breeze!

Want to chat about FLEX?ÿ Or maybe just say hey?ÿAsk me anything (nothing is TMI)!

Always here for you when you need me - even in the bathroom! :)

Saw your television advertisement on flexfits a couple of times.   It is my opinion that the ad is shockingly indiscreet and too graphic for a ?natural? women?s body function.    Your choice of words like smells, leaks, gross etc. and showing a huge pad is in poor taste and does not reflect the positive body image which your website seems to intend.

 

In addition, since this is a television commercial, men and children are also watching, and the subsequent message is that having a period is a gross experience instead of a ?natural? occurrence. 

 

I would suggest you rework this ad, clean up the language and make purchasing your products a more positive experience.     Lose the graphic language as most women know what a period is and should not have to be told it is gross to have a period.    You can also be helpful in providing better information, through more positive language, for consumers and future consumers. 

 

Hope this information is helpful.

To Whom It May Concern:

I do not wish to receive any further shipments of the flex product.  Our physician has advised my granddaughter not to use the product..  I have left a voice mail as well to cancel any shipments.

Sincerely,

"August was my first time using FLEX, and i absolutely loved it! I work in a huge factory (@Penguin Random House, in Crawfordsville, IN). There are over thousands of employees with the company. Ive been raving about Flex every chance i get. I wish i could advertise the product even without speaking first. If the flex company ever has merchandise they give out, like t-shirts (size Medium), id love one or a few :) A shirt that reads ""ask me about my flex"" would be super amazingly perfect.",156483

Hi Dana, nice to meet you! I?m Kat, your designated Flexpert.

Things You Should Know About Me

1. I started my period during the first day of soccer tryouts in 7th grade.
2. I know all of the lines in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets movie.
3. I?ve been to the last 6 Dapper Days at Disneyland.

Why We Were Matched Up / My Period Profile

1. I used to wear tampons like clockwork. Running to the bathroom every 2 hours to change it and it was terrible! I was nervous about trying FLEX because I was worried it would hurt, but I was stunned and pleasantly surprised when I tried and could actually not feel FLEX.
2. I have a heavy-to-medium flow depending on the day of my cycle. I can tell when it?s coming since I?ll start eating all of the chocolate and happy-crying to videos of puppies and kids getting adopted.

My First Time Trying FLEX

I couldn't get insertion right, which was super frustrating! I tried different positions until I found one that worked for me (one leg up on the tub!). Once I got that down, it was smooth sailing! Now my period week is a breeze!

Want to chat about FLEX?  Or maybe just say hey? Ask me anything (nothing is TMI)!

Always here for you when you need me - even in the bathroom! :)

Kat

Hi Deana! I?m Merissa, your designated Flexpert.

Why We Were Matched Up / My Period Profile

1. I used to use a menstrual cup, which gave me lots-o-extra time but ended up being painful and needy. FLEX gave me my life back without the hurt - I actually can?t feel it at all. 
2. I have a really heavy flow (I fill a super tampon in 1-3 hours) and cramps that felt like a mosh pit in my stomach.

Things You Should Know About Me

1. I started my period when I was 10 at a waterpark and was so confused! My mom wasn?t there and my dad got to handle it (like a champ, might I add).
2. I?m an avid runner and love being outside - movement is everything.
3. I grew up in a super small town. It has a population of just over 3,000, most of which are my family.

My First Time Trying FLEX

I tried FLEX on my heaviest day and found what looked like a war-zone in my chonies. Yes, leaks can happen while you're getting used to FLEX. But I?m now enjoying the most comfortable, leak-free period of my life! <3

Time to retire the painkillers. Over 65% of women have less cramps with FLEX than with traditional period products.

The disc sits in your vaginal fornix: a mysterious area between your vaginal canal and cervix. It's larger than you think and has less nerve endings so you won't even feel it.

The flexible disc contours to your body, meaning less discomfort and more freedom to live your life. 

Have the most comfortable period of your life.

Feeling nervous? Check out our 10 tips and tricks (http://click.aftership.com/wf/click?upn=Fcv0wu5A5W9ys2JnNCgqvgnhh1FpsS66YDox9i74ty5kqwCXcmNSsZdl-2Bign7Wqq9-2BljFEieuCT2KrySujnff0EYeHcoE2ck8rIZuTK8u8YRYaUxyHY0eWyJ2s7ixqTz_0cbtQh5VLws6Oc2gdbfLLWdLucjwGEDY827CxWHo1lerRVviOjvNPYqTM3qnqVt99dEkmtLsKAwm-2BtAQuZO6pRoeOQau7m2OYVKwn5Qxr1mR8x9oCeUx8fWZ2wzIMHnEbh419vwsD-2Bliwb7tgmcSGuftvwQdGoTEvTj4JxQYGDnK4kEbeXvLtXjFVbYSccEzfxHZh8cvFvskge3u3kcXvQiys8bxWxjXvHkbBuxFRHDlOHWlxnAV28Bgk1PyoHa7DSEIVi7MjGI-2B8DvFKuT2pQ7T41omc76Hv2n7Jue6-2B3t0O7fC-2FfUUyZw9K4-2FJGYlZ)  for your first time:

1. Always wash your hands. And take a deep breath. You've got this!

2. Start on a lighter day. Try your first FLEX on a lighter flow day, when you have some time to spare. So not when you?re at Coachella, on a 6-hour car ride, or when your flow is already Niagara Falls.

3. It may get a little messy. But not as messy as you might think. The average woman only menstruates about 1.5 tsp in 12 hrs. Just make sure to sit and keep your FLEX parallel to the floor as you remove it.

4. Wear a liner for backup. You shouldn?t need it once you get it down. But for your first time or two, it can?t hurt to have a contingency while you?re out and about, for a little peace of mind.

5. Push it back and down. Your FLEX will slide in easily. But as it does, keep it at an angle, all the way back and down behind the pubic bone, to ensure it covers fully around the base of your cervix.

6. Make sure you can?t feel it. If you can feel your FLEX inside you, that?s a good sign it?s not all the way in. I know this sounds weird, but when it?s inserted properly, you won?t even notice it?s there.

7. You can always adjust or re-insert. If it feels not quite right or like it?s leaking, try adjusting your FLEX while it?s inside you by pushing it farther down and back, or just take it out, empty it and try again.

8. Seeing blood when you pee (or poop) is normal. When you bear down on your pelvic muscles, your FLEX?s front edge may slide out from behind your pubic bone, letting some fluid out. This is nothing to worry about. Just make sure it?s tucked back into place when you?re done.

9. Pretend to poop to help remove. If you have trouble removing your FLEX, bear down on your pelvic muscles as if taking a poop. The front edge will pop out from behind your pubic bone, so it?s easier to reach.

10. Wait to remove it after sex. Vaginas can expand up to 200% during sex. As you can imagine, this might make your FLEX hard to remove. Give it at least 15min after sex so your vagina can return to size.


Give it a try and let us know what you think,

Subject: Change to your FLEX Subscription


Hi Bridget,

We have some great news for you! We?ve heard from our customers that $45 charged quarterly can be cost prohibitive so we?ve updated our subscription to be charged monthly to help offset the cost.

There is no action required for you. Once your trial period is over, you?ll automatically be switched over to an 8 pack shipped and billed monthly at $15. This change will be reflected on your account page within 48 hours. If you need more than 8 discs per month let us know and we?ll hook you up.

Our goal at The Flex Company is to deliver life changing period products to everyone. We?re constantly working to fulfill that mission and want to make sure you always have FLEX on hand when you need it.

Thank you for being such an awesome customer.

Thanks,

Flex Team",26251

"Awesome thanks Kat!

Got mine in 6th grade. Thought I was bleeding to death for a second, and then realized what it was and cried more LOL.

I'm definitely nervous about inserting and removing the first time, but if I have any issues I'll keep you in mind! (Replying to this will put this in my sent box so I won't have to sift through spam in my inbox to find it).

Thanks again and have a good day!

When I try my flex for the first time, not on my period, should I leave it in for 12 hours?

Hi Jamie!

I?m Kat, your designated Flexpert.

Why We Were Matched Up / My Period Profile

1. I used to wear pads like a baby in diapers - happy but not in control of what was happening around me. I wore pads because I don?t care what they say - I can always feel tampons! I was stunned and pleasantly surprised when I tried and could actually not feel FLEX.
2. I have a light-to-medium flow depending on the day of my cycle. I can tell when it?s coming since I?ll start eating all of the chocolate and happy-crying to videos of puppies and kids getting adopted.

Things You Should Know About Me

1. I started my period during the first day of soccer tryouts in 7th grade.
2. I know all of the lines in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.
3. I?ve been to the last 6 Dapper Days at Disneyland.

My First Time Trying FLEX

I couldn't get insertion right, which was super frustrating! I tried different positions until I found one that worked for me (one leg up on the tub!). Once I got that down, it was smooth sailing! Now my period week is a breeze!

"Awesome Zori,

Thanks so much for reaching out and being available to me.  Reading your email I realized that I missed out on an important key bit of info regarding Flex.  I didn't realize that there was a Flex Disc and a Flex Cup.  Why is that not more obvious in any of the advertisements or the order page?

Thank you,

Hi Lorraine,

Things you should know about me:

1. There's nothing I love more than parmesan cheese.
2. I got my first period when I was 11. I thought I was prepared for it until it actually happened?I think I cried for about 2 whole hours; the hormones combined with the idea I'd have to deal with blood coming out of an area that was extremely confusing to me at the time for basically the rest of my life freaked me out. Can you tell I was a dramatic kid?
3. I have a really heavy flow and pretty gnarly cramps. Most months it feels like my vagina/uterus betrayed me, but I power through it because I'm a badass and so are you.
4. My first crush ever was Bill Nye the Science Guy. (Still going strong btw... it's weird, I know, stop judging me please.)

Things I'd love to know about you

1. What's your go-to tv show or podcast?
2. What's your sign?
3. Do you know whether or not Bill Nye is single?

My First Time Trying FLEX

It was pretty easy, I was scared, but quickly realized that my biggest issue was that I was overthinking it. Once I relaxed and tried it a couple time, I got it to stay in the right spot. Now, I use my FLEX discs on my lighter days, and my Flex Cup on the heavier ones.

Using discs and the cup has completely changed my definition of what TMI means; I used to be very shy, and self-conscious about my body/period. But now, I will literally have a conversation about my vagina just as casually as I'd talk about my foot or arm. I've never felt more empowered to be myself.

Let me know if you have any questions about using your disc; I've heard it all! Or if you just want to say hello, that's okay too! If you're not comfortable with reaching out to me, we have tons of helpful articles available in our FAQ. Here's a handy link (https://trk.klclick2.com/ls/click?upn=rrhvyJmnIAFv7avyRI6elE2ehM-2BcdQCawdQ6SpkT1YYGiHJ1DFPgIFDnYTFArAyR7BtD3NQSUdHOsSeOhjdnfqqPobswbBWMsz-2F9japhFvf8NptdtKVBMkidevw1y68FNff8mSjTU0zw-2F1brcEZ0cW6qe7Eh9uxFwoqrNhOFep-2F10cnLdvdgysfUvfwQ6f3H7AWdL3GwAyq0vJopiu6nyXPaoMQkXJton1RybQLRzgs0R7NmC4ofIHg9P7WQ5JHWXLL-2BwIYdaLLjhco2UWrl30ly8g2dquLURCJsTmcRZ9cLFu3p8i2taCLrixjDs68krBYK-2BaA8hufi0OLP2-2Bgiig5qm0FdWOP-2Fo64xPlg8eFxLcfF0OR790zt-2BQMWz7bAIbeQOCdY68FMZzaJemjiaHfIwFfht-2FNXEl9dkVLcitpQ-3Dwp2g_B0qqY2mKQCnAOf29ixqsrdUjJdGXgwNJz6AzO4csYwloghIa5a89kkiY8Q-2FdjLWV1g9x6OLNXcbFPbo0P3KDz-2FbY33cZTDUIHT9u55XZneM2FLFeJK1ZucKp68Oukd2En2DjRmnX7i3N7iT8Wi-2FRrEsBV3jnmf1ZbWrKYlfGsq4IVFzEDxZ6YwBP2vmU8-2FtA2E5GmEz5pZOE1I5MqaxwQpKZ-2Fs7rxB2iAaFycAcYSjOPdGPaMHY-2FPfZh6ijKWHE6p3oGp2MEaQI4wlRxZQ-2FRoZGSg9mOb27BbhOyr7e19BfhXwhkNyhI8e91xEXnDAgkisw86dT0j40pkg2OUqB4f3l5cpMa734gaRYoBYcAUGZHvlESXgHlswaYBhpVAcLac81FsuVLAwuPDZK-2FGcP28A-3D-3D) if you're looking for more information about insertion and removal.

Subject: Tips + Tricks from your Flexpert


Hello salina,

I'm Helena, your designated Flexpert.

Trying FLEX can seem daunting, even a little intimidating at first. But I wanted to let you know that you're not alone. I've been there and use FLEX myself so please consider me a guide through the trial process.

A little about me...

  1.  My friends and family live for my character impressions - from Cher, to Julia Childs, to Lois from Family Guy.
  2.  I'm addicted to true crime everything - books, podcasts, shows. Not on my watch! ;)
  3.  On a Friday night, you'll find me having a glass of wine, binging one of my fave shows, and snuggling with my sweet pup, Willie.

My Period Profile

  1.  I started my period on my 14th birthday at a bowling alley party.
  2.  I've tried pads, tampons, period panties, cups. I've done it all!
  3.  I have a medium flow and my cycle is predictable - unlike my love life.

My First Time Trying Flex

I was really nervous and had to take a few deep breaths, but it was way easier than I thought it would be.

Hello Sydney,

I'm Helena, your designated Flexpert.

Trying FLEX can seem daunting, even a little intimidating at first. But I wanted to let you know that you're not alone. I've been there and use FLEX myself so please consider me a guide through the trial process.

A little about me...

1. My friends and family live for my character impressions - from Cher, to Julia Childs, to Lois from Family Guy.
2. I'm addicted to true crime everything - books, podcasts, shows. Not on my watch! ;)
3. On a Friday night, you'll find me having a glass of wine, binging one of my fave shows, and snuggling with my sweet pup, Willie.

My Period Profile

1. I started my period on my 14th birthday at a bowling alley party.
2. I've tried pads, tampons, period panties, cups. I've done it all!
3. I have a medium flow and my cycle is predictable - unlike my love life.

My First Time Trying Flex

I was really nervous and had to take a few deep breaths, but it was way easier than I thought it would be.

If you received an order cancellation email last night, I want to let you know that your order for the $15 three-month trial of FLEX is still going out and that has nothing changed with your order.

"Awesome!  Hi Kat!  Nice to meet you!

Thanks for the tips and info!  All good things to know!  So I?m a mom of 3 (all via c-section).  Been married almost 14 years!  I?m a stay at home mom and chase my kids around everywhere!  Our two boys are 12 and 9 and our daughter is 16 months!  We waited almost 9 years to start over again - crazy, but fun!  And now we are complete!  We live on our family ranch and have lots of cattle!  We are involved in stock-shows where our boys show steers....and our daughter even loves them, too!  She leads them around on a halter just like the boys do!  In fact, I posted a video on Facebook of her doing so and it went viral!  Lol!  Kind of cool!  We are just down to earth and a very family oriented!

I?m really excited about trying flex!  I?m so over tampons!  And I?m tired of having to put my husbands and my romance life on hold for 6 to 7 days each month.  I?m just ready to feel like I?m normal 30/31 days a month!  Can?t wait to get my package in the mail!

Again, thanks for the info!

Have a great day!

Hi Megan, nice to meet you! I?m Kat, your designated Flexpert.

Things You Should Know About Me

  1.  I started my period during the first day of soccer tryouts in 7th grade.
  2.  I know all of the lines in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets movie.
  3.  I?ve been to the last 6 Dapper Days at Disneyland.

Why We Were Matched Up / My Period Profile

  1.  I used to wear tampons like clockwork. Running to the bathroom every 2 hours to change it and it was terrible! I was nervous about trying FLEX because I was worried it would hurt, but I was stunned and pleasantly surprised when I tried and could actually not feel FLEX.
  2.  I have a heavy-to-medium flow depending on the day of my cycle. I can tell when it?s coming since I?ll start eating all of the chocolate and happy-crying to videos of puppies and kids getting adopted.

My First Time Trying FLEX

I couldn't get insertion right, which was super frustrating! I tried different positions until I found one that worked for me (one leg up on the tub!). Once I got that down, it was smooth sailing! Now my period week is a breeze!

Want to chat about FLEX?  Or maybe just say hey? Ask me anything (nothing is TMI)!

Always here for you when you need me - even in the bathroom! :)

Kat

Hi Christi, nice to meet you! I?m Kat, your designated Flexpert.

Things You Should Know About Me:

1. I started my period during the first day of soccer tryouts in 7th grade, let's just say I didn't make the team...
2. I know all of the lines in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets movie. (I'm a Hufflepuff!)
3. I?m a Disney nerd and my second home is pretty much Disneyland.

My Period Profile:

I used to use tampons like clockwork. Running to the bathroom every 2 hours to change it and it was terrible and uncomfortable! I was silently unhappy for years until I found FLEX. I was nervous about trying FLEX because I was worried it would hurt, but I was stunned and pleasantly surprised when I tried and could actually not feel FLEX once it was in!

I have a heavy-to-medium flow depending on the day of my cycle. I can tell when it's coming since I'll start eating all of the ice cream and happy-crying videos of puppies and kids getting adopted.

My First Time Trying FLEX:

I couldn't get insertion right, which was super frustrating! I tried different positions until I found one that worked for me (one leg up on the tub!). Once I got that down, it was smooth sailing! Now my period week is a breeze!

Here is a helpful link if you're looking for more tips on how to use FLEX: Insertion + Removal (https://trk.klclick2.com/wf/click?upn=gE02jo8QEQs-2FEOLihAE5V-2FcbHv8Pe6HKYuMx3AXUUDnlTbyAm4L7YxkzytGTJ3KPQdidYaCY-2Fywa5lPYfeVv7avRwhLUBjFXdVoP9C-2BczR2ftNXlfGUMZ1xnzsh55DWSlzZI6VDqmWV5lcDi2HPl-2FoABvtJsu4IsLTm-2Ffdllr2iypzzx0ELOrY6w4y760wJg-2B7V2R1X2GyoSJNTJ-2BeLfi6MbKAPBO0agsMzxxsMlOg3fXdu9k9szIQrzCt2ct-2Bdhjkep1ozLBY5TaJkW-2FdqBZDYeylUw2sWhDNYJuGb4NV9lo1O-2F5CI-2BeJ6KSox2BhNF1syntbRtJVaww3NGTUveqU6rCI2gzWLfHA8bvDKcT2yLKu74U7ENVk3Gxfi-2FxP2Vkn0jCEqb2ssj-2B7Z7boz0en-2FZrUz4P896X-2FfZmdFdNM0Yu3a0bgLfTbipQsVIO65O2tdjU6tWk8MvpZcKQNkL0w8mJFFDHTol5-2Fd508A2RbFj70Z0ndhxVvFU326US2LVdqlSM-2BBvXtbkBUeWB31hGii8XZm5-2FvQRJEhYqB5PKdSdkDYINdgL1oQ9DmfK5GvDxf-2FPGRUoUHUKFQjRN4M36Oyzd3yQbemVeVwL5JW2yiwjoCD47UE-2F0H6e2pDja5ff9Ylk3BboPqsKbY2qHAHKxe-2BHvXNNVaZI1MtZMwR7eSo-3D_W77bTy6YRdHySgTK0Dy8Rb4d-2FOK13cYEWu04CY6Ya9loePDw7pkPv0SEgSpD8WZA8v8ye9iifn-2Fou5ReWXvUJIZXIv08URY-2BON4kNU-2BSI7B0XrwI1XKvPp8VMdwvRcM-2B3KQOzFXmUqxUJFQV2SNhkvOpbt5zK0N2LEyFi3-2FhObWe8c4YHPKS-2BmxIOBnxLHh-2Ffu-2BxSybDE-2BJfxkPrwA-2FKBawtX-2BfCZSIXG7cu9sGuReXEh-2BbW-2BavDdC1JvTmg-2F3VBCrtV3YYNOMWdO39bFRSaG4e3alkqDmjtNEDpzlPl3NcZR2VivKuFN-2B5QWGH7Om42XkzeBAD4C5S2do0IoGHANOUHHEsQRLH5sIesTAPH6LAzYQJz7UYHu5n6WTl-2BEAJq5R3MWrdAhxXEuA2hCwIb0w-3D-3D) .

Hello Kaitlyn,

I'm Helena, your designated Flexpert.

Trying FLEX can seem daunting, even a little intimidating at first. But I wanted to let you know that you're not alone. I've been there and use FLEX myself so please consider me a guide through the trial process.

A little about me...

1. My friends and family live for my character impressions - from Cher, to Julia Childs, to Lois from Family Guy.
2. I'm addicted to true crime everything - books, podcasts, shows. Not on my watch! ;)
3. On a Friday night, you'll find me having a glass of wine, binging one of my fave shows, and snuggling with my sweet pup, Willie.

My Period Profile

1. I started my period on my 14th birthday at a bowling alley party.
2. I've tried pads, tampons, period panties, cups. I've done it all!
3. I have a medium flow and my cycle is predictable - unlike my love life.

My First Time Trying Flex

I was really nervous and had to take a few deep breaths, but it was way easier than I thought it would be. Now, my first removal was another story. A comical disaster, but lesson learned. Pee before you remove is all I'll say. ;)

Want to chat about FLEX? Or maybe just say hey? Ask me anything - I've heard it all (nothing is TMI).

xx

Helena

Hi Leesa,

I?m Zori, your designated Flexpert!

Things you should know about me

1. There's nothing I love more than parmesan cheese.
2. I got my first period when I was 11.

My First Time Trying FLEX

It was pretty easy, I was scared, but quickly realized that my biggest issue was that I was overthinking it. Once I relaxed and tried it a couple time, I got it to stay in the right spot. Now, I use my FLEX discs on my lighter days, and my Flex Cup on the heavier ones.

Using discs and the cup has completely changed my definition of what TMI means; I used to be very shy, and self-conscious about my body/period. But now, I will literally have a conversation about my vagina just as casually as I'd talk about my foot or arm. I've never felt more empowered to be myself. 

Let me know if you have any questions about using your disc; I've heard it all! Or if you just want to say hello, that's okay too! If you're not comfortable with reaching out to me, we have tons of helpful articles available in our FAQ (https://trk.klclick2.com/wf/click?upn=gE02jo8QEQs-2FEOLihAE5V-2FcbHv8Pe6HKYuMx3AXUUDnlTbyAm4L7YxkzytGTJ3KPI-2FnYkwH-2Fwkvx8m6UXXwOfChlo27iQfBs34YLMgn2icxNzOi3xNqjJaMAgCyWJnMqDHLqudjN0ZwFeVU6s8kc1-2BFsySdnqTxwwIch049k6ene-2BgWMCoaoIyzeOK1SBLjmttWwZ0jG7pmSHcAPBt1hVvRfBU3GPCFtnsU1gdTZrpNIFufTlPLSxQ2AdV-2BoTn79rx6NLe8irziI-2FfcaChAxkTta3HjC0zIC7bsoU8GuLmaJNoe3eBAdZ7c5TTISBggX2jEefpxOC2tRYn9x51l8-2FnIrfozGfP6l7D-2F5b4SPJYDB2XeiGN8oBGmv8SudHgUCTPIeQT2ZzkMTImBRdvIGM8rtBQRkXkEn5WBOwHUYcLpyrBC-2FZSrbh-2BkkhS9t7EoJRsfUitMRNUJypVBO15QF5eSl6PuyQde2GQ01-2F5bxTmRc7AFPtFofVwB7THjb74iePZHrBgCLF7py74V1tS7b3omlXcaCGHqaKqDbGZkiT1ERm8Ex91B0-2F7fGVpusRiWLQ8IJAZ-2B8jylRAEWFn3q0VQ-3D-3D_b6hSlITRM8qKhg0v6CZblEzokylPpO8sktl5W0CMALIis8FQ7AIPzQLc5eE-2BCWN8UeQ-2BE-2FtKps8yCsKmxn53JFM1pMcWTbPCOqvI6Rdj42XVqOyBYQOlSCkPG5u-2Bvq9msce5ZwY4KmVikk-2FU-2FwGEVy3W5zEdifV-2FB1aaCUowZ-2BClVsFCyy1jEGlhbEVl7pBZ-2Bk-2BBJDcllFxT-2Bm5rKSIibqAP-2BLxsYaxUo2nVpXLrtf9bmKWfCYXu-2FduYQQ-2F7hgK-2F3T1UXcVrwdwCkr3ytiBIV1Xj-2FuYkI5zSpveQsAAtIpJsv-2FpfmgTf6LYeWZs8y8rMM0xGB6x6L-2FdG-2B2haQIOvy4V1CvMg4k4AcQu9gw-2FVObvbvatoBq-2BZEMj1f9ZoeCRWApo8r49hPgvnmdsXIQuw0g-3D-3D) .

Hi Cynthia Marie,

I?m Zori, your designated FLEXpert!

Things you should know about me:

  1.  There's nothing I love more than parmesan cheese.
  2.  I got my first period when I was 11. I thought I was prepared for it until it actually happened?I think I cried for about 2 whole hours; the hormones combined with the idea I'd have to deal with blood coming out of an area that was extremely confusing to me at the time for basically the rest of my life freaked me out. Can you tell I was a dramatic kid?
  3.  I have a really heavy flow and pretty gnarly cramps. Most months it feels like my vagina/uterus betrayed me, but I power through it because I'm a badass and so are you.
  4.  My first crush ever was Bill Nye the Science Guy. (Still going strong btw... it's weird, I know, stop judging me please.)

Things I'd love to know about you

  1.  What's your go-to tv show or podcast?
  2.  What's your sign?
  3.  Do you know whether or not Bill Nye is single?

My First Time Trying FLEX

It was pretty easy, I was scared, but quickly realized that my biggest issue was that I was overthinking it. Once I relaxed and tried it a couple time, I got it to stay in the right spot. Now, I use my FLEX discs on my lighter days, and my Flex Cup on the heavier ones.

Using discs and the cup has completely changed my definition of what TMI means; I used to be very shy, and self-conscious about my body/period. But now, I will literally have a conversation about my vagina just as casually as I'd talk about my foot or arm. I've never felt more empowered to be myself.

Let me know if you have any questions about using your disc; I've heard it all! Or if you just want to say hello, that's okay too!

I thought that, maybe because of my tilted uterus, I was going to be in that small percentage of menstruating humans that FLEX wasn't going to work for. I was super bummed, but even more determined! After some trial and error, I discovered that inserting FLEX while squatting was the perfect way for me to get it in at the right angle for my anatomy and pushed far enough back to completely cover my cervix. Now it works like a dream and I will never go back to using tampons.

Hi Kelly,

We have some great news for you! We?ve reduced the cost of your monthly 8 pack subscription to $15/month, saving you $5 every month. This change will go into effect for your next monthly order of FLEX, and be reflected on your account page within 48 hours.

Our goal at The Flex Company is to deliver life changing period products to everyone. We?re constantly working to fulfill that mission and realize price is a factor. We worked to reduce our own costs and wanted to pass that savings on to you.  

Thank you for being such an awesome customer.

Thanks,

Flex Team

I really hate periods because they are uncomfortable for me. I am excited to try FLEX because I can wear them for 12 hours, I can go to the bathroom with it in, they don't leak, and I can have mess free sex! Amazing. I can't wait to try them out.

Hi Jayla, nice to meet you! I?m Kat, your designated Flexpert.

Things You Should Know About Me

1. I started my period during the first day of soccer tryouts in 7th grade.
2. I know all of the lines in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets movie.
3. I?ve been to the last 6 Dapper Days at Disneyland.

Why We Were Matched Up / My Period Profile

1. I used to wear tampons like clockwork. Running to the bathroom every 2 hours to change it and it was terrible! I was nervous about trying FLEX because I was worried it would hurt, but I was stunned and pleasantly surprised when I tried and could actually not feel FLEX.
2. I have a heavy-to-medium flow depending on the day of my cycle. I can tell when it?s coming since I?ll start eating all of the chocolate and happy-crying to videos of puppies and kids getting adopted.

My First Time Trying FLEX

I couldn't get insertion right, which was super frustrating! I tried different positions until I found one that worked for me (one leg up on the tub!). Once I got that down, it was smooth sailing! Now my period week is a breeze!

Want to chat about FLEX?  Or maybe just say hey? Ask me anything (nothing is TMI)!

Always here for you when you need me - even in the bathroom! :)

Hi Lindy,

We?ve got some great news and some not so great news. 

The great news is that there are thousands of people like you using FLEX as their primary period product! The not so great news is that we didn?t expect to be this popular and we?re experiencing slight delays in shipping.

We are doing everything we can to get you FLEX as soon as possible so you can have it when you need it. We?ve expedited your shipment so it will ship by the beginning of next week and reach you by the end of next week. If your cycle is coming up sooner, just reply to this email and let us know. We?ll do our best to help you out. 

To thank you for your patience, we are adding a $5 credit to your account that will be applied to your next order of FLEX.

Hello Iva,

I'm Helena, your designated Flexpert.

Trying FLEX can seem daunting, even a little intimidating at first. But I wanted to let you know that you're not alone. I've been there and use FLEX myself so please consider me a guide through the trial process.

A little about me...
   
   - My friends and family live for my character impressions - from Cher, to Julia Childs, to Lois from Family Guy.
   - I'm addicted to true crime everything - books, podcasts, shows. Not on my watch! ;)
   - On a Friday night, you'll find me having a glass of wine, binging one of my fave shows, and snuggling with my sweet pup, Willie.

My Period Profile
   
   - I started my period on my 14th birthday at a bowling alley party.
   - I've tried pads, tampons, period panties, cups. I've done it all!
   - I have a medium flow and my cycle is predictable - unlike my love life.

My First Time Trying Flex

I was really nervousÿand had to take a few deep breaths, but it was way easier than I thought it would be. Now, my first removal was another story. A comical disaster, but lesson learned. Pee before you remove is all I'll say. ;)

Want to chat about FLEX? Or maybe just say hey? Ask me anything - I've heard it all (nothing is TMI).

xx

Helena

Why We Were Matched Up / My Period Profile

2. I have a medium/average flow and my cycle is predictable unlike my love life.

Things You Should Know About Me

1. I started my period on my 14th birthday at a bowling alley party.

I wish I'd seen that on the site earlier. I can't return the small, and it's completely wrong for me. I leaked majorly with it, and the blood mostly went around the cup as opposed to inside it. I bought it because the other brand I've been using leaks a little, and I was intrigued by the flex design. I'm too afraid to buy the larger cup because I don't want to waste money yet again. I'm not sure what my point is, as I know the return policy, but I'm just not sure how one can ""try out"" different cups to find the right one without spending tons of money (and creating trash when it doesn't work out).

The way it sits in me would not allow sex because when I stick my finger in, I am hitting the edge of it barely at the tip of my finger. Not to be too graphic, but if a guys part was going in, it would just be hitting the rim of the flex and shoving the whole thing in deeper.

I am no athlete or person doing flips and squats all day, just a stay at home mom of toddlers, so I feel like if it can stay in place for people who are actually physically active all day, I must be doing something wrong. Within a couple hours, the tail is poking out of my vagina and the cup is being held in by my underwear. It's incredibly uncomfortable, because I feel it constantly once it gets low like this. It doesn't leak though! When I pull it out, it sounds like a light suction is being broken, but there is not much resistance when removing it, even if I pull it by the base of the cup rather than the loop. I asked if there was anything unique or unusual about my internal anatomy at my recent gynocological  visit, thinking that might shed some light on my issue with menstrual cups, but no. Help, please!

"Before I say anything, you're probably wondering why I just wished you Merry Christmas during the Summer! The thing is, with everything going on in the world, I was trying to think of reasons as to why life is actually great right now, and the classic scene fromÿIt's a Wonderful Life where Mr. Bailey is eccentrically shouting, ""Merry Christmas"" popped into my head!
It is an older movie, so if you haven't seen it for a while here's the clip I'm referring to:ÿhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh9bysstR6A
Anyways, If I haven't confused you enough already, the reason I wanted to get in touch today was to inquire about any advertising opportunities onÿflexfits.com. I work with a variety of clients with budget that have expressed interested in partnering up with well-known sites like yours to help share their content with similarly minded readers.
If you have any opportunities available, please let me know and we can discuss the details!

Subject: URGENT - Customs entry charges claim

Hello,

I am about to receive my latest order but I appears that the order is blocked at customs and that I am now asked to pay customs entry charges in order to release this order, which has never happened in the past. If the charges are not lis before August 7th, the package will be either sent back to you or destroyed.

I have attached the pictures of the letter I received from Royal Mail.


Please kindly advise on what to do as I should not pay any additional cost nor loose my shipment.

Tracking Number: GM605116851000037698



Thank you.
Kind regards,

| 
Pinch
FLEX may look big but it's actually smaller than a tampon when you insert it. Start by washing your hands and pinching it in half. |

 |


| 
|  |

 |

 |

 |
| 
| 
| 
| 
Insert

Sit on the toilet and slide into the vaginal canal, pushing back and down as far as it will comfortably go (typically the length of your index finger). 

Use your finger to tuck the front edge up behind your pubic bone so the disc rests slightly diagonally. This will create a seal at the base of your cervix. 



If you are having a tough time inserting FLEX, try a different position. We recommend squatting or putting one foot on the tub.
 |

 |

 |


| 
| 
Wear

While you?re learning how to use FLEX, we recommend using pads or liners for peace of mind. Once you get placement right, you won?t need them anymore. 

Only 36% of women get placement right on the first try. Stick with it. 
 |

 |


| 
|  |

 |


| 
| 
Remove

Wash your hands and sit on the toilet. Hook your finger under the front edge of the disc and pull straight out, keeping FLEX parallel to the floor. 

ÿ

Place FLEX back in the wrapper and toss it in the trash.

ÿ

How to avoid a messy removal?

With practice, ÿyou should be able to remove FLEX over the toilet without a mess. On heavy days, we recommend taking it out in the shower.

"Belittling other women for choosing to wear otheR types of period hygiene products is trashy and does not make me want to buy your product. I haven?t seen this much shaming in a period commercial since watching old mid twenty century commercials. Some women have medical conditions that do not allow for the use of insertable products.

Unfortunately, I saw no reason to save receipt since it is non returnable item nor the box because once I opened it the product was intact.  I know I bought at the Target in Fairfield, NJ and paid cash since I did check my credit card statement.

"Below please find a recap of the Pepperdine Graziadio Healthcare Symposium. It was a great event and we hope you can join us next year. Save the date ? April 2, 2020 for the 6th annual Future of Healthcare Symposium (https://bschool.pepperdine.edu/events/healthcare-symposium/) .

 

Healthcare Visionaries Go ?Deep? at 2019 Pepperdine Graziadio Future of Healthcare Symposium

 

The 2019 word of the year in healthcare is ?deep!?

 

That?s the declaration from renown physician Dr. Eric Topol, Founder and Director of The Scripps Translational Science Institute. Crediting New York Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman for introducing the concept, Dr. Topol discussed in a recent hour-long keynote how artificial intelligence (AI) and other forms of digitization will transform the healthcare industry. The journey to ?deep? healthcare will use these break- through approaches to deliver never-before-imagined solutions. The pronouncement was just one of many breakthrough ideas discussed at Pepperdine Graziadio Business School?s Annual Future of Healthcare Symposium (https://bschool.pepperdine.edu/events/healthcare-symposium/) on March 21, 2019 at The Ritz-Carlton in Marina del Rey.

 

Dr. Topol, author of Healthcare Leadership in the AI Revolution: Opportunity in the Smart Machine Age, made clear that AI will impact healthcare delivery, patient care and overall health understanding. Dr. Topol also described the impact of AI on the future of work. He noted that healthcare recently overtook retail as the leading area of employment in the U.S. However, he cautioned that the U.S. cannot continue to rely on human capital to drive innovation and change. He stated that AI and technology will can play a transformational role in balancing labor demand, reducing costs and dramatically improving care. 

 

In the second keynote address, Jeff Stibel, PhD, former CEO of Web.com, vice chairman of Dun & Bradstreet, and a partner of Bryant Stibel, shared insights on brain health. In his presentation, Brain Science Is Smart Science, Stibel discussed the brain and described how his company, BrainGate, is using AI to advance neuroscience and treat patients with severe neurological disorders. Stibel showed how it is possible to connect the mind to a machine through new technology enabling people without functional motor skills to use their thoughts and electrical currents in the brain to turn off and on lights, achieve mobility and perform other tasks. 

 

Other industry leaders discussed rapid changes that professionals will need to navigate and master in the smart machine age as AI plays an outsized role in the healthcare space. In panel settings, multiple experts described cutting-edge ideas and practices that will revolutionize healthcare. 

 

Kim Kamdar, PhD, a partner at Domain Associates; Belinda Tan, MD, PhD, co-founder of Science 37; and Visar Berisha, PhD, co-founder and chief science officer of Aural Analytics described new business models and proofs of concept using smart technology will generate progressive clinical trials and enhance patient experiences and outcomes. Panel members also discussed how AI will enable healthcare providers to move from just addressing symptoms and treating disease to collecting population data and identifying markers that enhance prevention on a large scale.

 

Rajan Merchant, MD, a board-certified allergist-immunologist based and Fellow of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology; Samuel Seaman, PhD, a professor of decision sciences at Pepperdine Graziadio Business School; and Lisa Watanabe, MD, Chief Medical Officer at CureMetrix, shared how data reliability, validity and potentials for bias are impacting critical areas of medicine including clinical trials, ethics and evidence-based decision-making. Panel members also discussed chronic health conditions such as asthma and how using mathematical, analytics and technology approaches can aid decision making and treatments.

?If you weren?t there, you missed a dynamic set of speakers painting a vivid picture of the future of healthcare,? said Stevan Calvillo, Chairman, Graziadio Board, Pepperdine Graziadio Business School.  ?I am very excited for next year when we will start to see the reality of our forward-looking symposium over the past five years, reflect what is actually happening in a large scale in the healthcare industry.? 

 

In his closing remarks, John Figueroa, Graziadio Alumnus (97? MBA) said: ?Technology is already making a difference in quality of care ?. and transparency and costs will be radically enhanced by Artificial Intelligence. I marvel at the technology and can?t wait to see what the future holds!?

Let's look back on how far you've come and what lies in store for you. Hint: It's the most comfortable period of your life.

The Emotional Rollercoaster That Is Trying a Menstrual Disc for The First Time

 

SCROLL AWAY

? You saw an ad for the first time.

? What the? Wait. WHAT? How?!

? Learning that tampons were invented by a man in the 1930s.

? ...and then all the sudden you're woke and order the trial.

? FLEX arrives and you see how big it is.

? But you think f*** it, LET'S DO THIS.

? When you open it for the first time and it flies out of the package.

? You finally wrangle one and put it in.

? But you're too nervous to let it go because you think it's going to be lost forever.

? And then you finally do and you can't feel it at all.

? Then you realize you're not supposed to feel it and start to think F*** TAMPONS.

? You pee for the first time with a menstrual disc in and there's blood in the toilet bowl.

? And you're like oh my god it's leaking.

? But you realize that's normal, too, and go about your day.

? You completely forget you're even on your period.

? Even your cramps are gone!

? You remove it for the first time thinking...

? But remember the shower tip and it's a breeze.

? You throw away all your tampons.

? And live happily ever after with a new outlook on life: I can conquer anything.

The most comfortable period of your life has begun.

Also I had my first period when I was in the third grade! That was once then again in fifth grade! Never stopped after that! 
Period is heavy but then gets lighter and lighter then it just stops!

Hi Ashley,

I?m Zori, your designated FLEXpert!

Things you should know about me:

1. There's nothing I love more than parmesan cheese.
2. I got my first period when I was 11. I thought I was prepared for it until it actually happened?I think I cried for about 2 whole hours; the hormones combined with the idea I'd have to deal with blood coming out of an area that was extremely confusing to me at the time for basically the rest of my life freaked me out. Can you tell I was a dramatic kid?
3. I have a really heavy flow and pretty gnarly cramps. Most months it feels like my vagina/uterus betrayed me, but I power through it because I'm a badass and so are you.
4. My first crush ever was Bill Nye the Science Guy. (Still going strong btw... it's weird, I know, stop judging me please.)

Things I'd love to know about you

1. What's your go-to tv show or podcast?
2. What's your sign?
3. Do you know whether or not Bill Nye is single?

My First Time Trying FLEX

It was pretty easy, I was scared, but quickly realized that my biggest issue was that I was overthinking it. Once I relaxed and tried it a couple time, I got it to stay in the right spot. Now, I use my FLEX discs on my lighter days, and my Flex Cup on the heavier ones.

Using discs and the cup has completely changed my definition of what TMI means; I used to be very shy, and self-conscious about my body/period. But now, I will literally have a conversation about my vagina just as casually as I'd talk about my foot or arm. I've never felt more empowered to be myself.

Let me know if you have any questions about using your disc; I've heard it all! Or if you just want to say hello, that's okay too! If you're not comfortable with reaching out to me, we have tons of helpful articles available in our FAQ.

Hi Joe,


I?m Erika, cofounder of The Flex Company - nice to e-meet you!

I wanted to personally welcome you to the Flex family. We?re on a mission to create body-positive, life-changing experiences through the products that we make and the conversations that we spark. Our vision is to reimagine and deliver life-changing period products everywhere. Thank you for helping us get there.

You?ve now committed to a 90 day challenge to change the way you live life during your period. During that time I?m going to send you 10 emails which will:

* Give you transparency into our team and our products
* Teach you how to use a menstrual disc
* Lay out the common pain points & how to work through them
* Provide you access to a real person (her name is Kate) for additional help
* Give you ideas on what to do with all the time you?ll get back
* Teach you a bit more about how FLEX measures up against tampons

"Bleeders Are Leaders aims to connect with 13,000 people this fall at GeekGirlCon to demonstrate the range of menstrual management products currently available to Bleeders. Would you be interested in supplying us with product samples for us to display and/or distribute?


To my great excitement, we, Bleeders Are Leaders, have been chosen to host a GeekGirlConnections table at the 7th annual GeekGirlCon in Seattle this fall (""GGC17"") and conference organizers anticipate around 13,000 attendees. GGC celebrates the role of women in science, technology, media, and gaming, and brings people together to share their geeky quirks.


Bleeders Are Leaders has previously hosted menstrual health conventions--first as a Girl Scout silver award and then as a passion project--and has recently begun hosting tables at public events. Our ""Menses Managed"" project displays items that support menstrual hygiene, including disposable and reusable varieties of pads, tampons, flow cups, and leak-proof panties. Participants are encouraged to examine, touch, and ask questions about options available to menstruating individuals (aka Bleeders).


The samples you contribute would be freely given to attendees, to encourage them to find the best fits for their lifestyles. Any undistributed samples will be donated to local food banks where tight budgets often preclude easy access to hygiene products. Even a single product sample is appreciated, as it will help us illustrate the cornucopia of options for Bleeders for every gender and body type.


GGC17 is September 30 and October 1 this year, so I would need to have items in-hand no later than September 25. I hope this request strikes you as an opportunity to show Bleeders the benefits of your products and I look forward to hearing back.


Sincerely yours,

Hi Aysegul,


I?m Erika, cofounder of The Flex Company.

This is quite possibly the most exciting day of your life. Know why? Because your FLEX order has shipped!

Keep an eye on where it is and where it?s going:

Feeling nervous? Check out ourÿ10 tips and tricksÿfor your first time:






1. Always wash your hands. And take a deep breath. You've got this!

2. Start on a lighter day. Try your first FLEX on a lighter flow day, when you have some time to spare. So not when you?re at Coachella, on a 6-hour car ride, or when your flow is already Niagara Falls.

3. It may get a little messy. But not as messy as you might think. The average woman only menstruates about 1.5 tsp in 12 hrs. Just make sure to sit and keep your FLEX parallel to the floor as you remove it.

4. Wear a liner for backup. You shouldn?t need it once you get it down. But for your first time or two, it can?t hurt to have a contingency while you?re out and about, for a little peace of mind.

5. Push it back and down. Your FLEX will slide in easily. But as it does, keep it at an angle, all the way back and down behind the pubic bone, to ensure it covers fully around the base of your cervix.

6. Make sure you can?t feel it. If you can feel your FLEX inside you, that?s a good sign it?s not all the way in. I know this sounds weird, but when it?s inserted properly, you won?t even notice it?s there.

7. You can always adjust or re-insert. If it feels not quite right or like it?s leaking, try adjusting your FLEX while it?s inside you by pushing it farther down and back, or just take it out, empty it and try again.

8. Seeing blood when you pee (or poop) is normal. When you bear down on your pelvic muscles, your FLEX?s front edge may slide out from behind your pubic bone, letting some fluid out. This is nothing to worry about. Just make sure it?s tucked back into place when you?re done.

9. Pretend to poop to help remove. If you have trouble removing your FLEX, bear down on your pelvic muscles as if taking a poop. The front edge will pop out from behind your pubic bone, so it?s easier to reach.

10. Wait to remove it after sex. Vaginas can expand up to 200% during sex. As you can imagine, this might make your FLEX hard to remove. Give it at least 15min after sex so your vagina can return to size.








Give it a try and let us know what you think,


Erika

   - I?m obsessed with Lizzo. My Google Home is programmed to play her music every time I get home from work. I can?t NOT dance and feel better after a stressful day.
   - I?m addicted to podcasts - from true crime to dating stories to financial advice.
   - On a Friday night, you'll find me having a glass of wine and snuggling with my sweet pup, Willie. #singlelife
My Period Profile   
   - I started my period on my 14th birthday at a bowling alley party.
   - I've tried pads, tampons, period panties, cups. I've done it all!
   - I have a medium flow and my cycle is predictable. If only everything else in life was?
My First Time Trying FlexÿI was really nervous and literally had to take a few deep breaths, but it was way easier than I thought it would be. If you?re like me and like to do as much research as you can when you?re anxious, you can check out our our Help Center for advice and helpful tips on everything from insertion, to removal, to sex with FLEX.ÿAnd there?s me! Ask me anything - I've heard it all (nothing is TMI).ÿXXHelena |

"blockquote, div.yahoo_quoted { margin-left: 0 !important; border-left:1px #715FFA solid !important; padding-left:1ex !important; background-color:white !important; } Hello,My name is Renee, I'm a college student and new customer at flex. I had my first two months of flex shipped to my apartment in Boston, then I came home for the summer. I just saw that my third month shipped, but I forgot to change my shipping address to home address. I just went on the website and updated my address for the future, but I was wondering what my options were for this month's order. It'll arrive at my apartment and no one will be there to pick it up. Let me know if you can help! (:

Hi DIANEÿ



I try to personally check in with all of our customers (we?re growing fast so who knows how long I can keep it up) just to see how it?s going. How?s FLEX working for you? Or have you not had a chance to try it yet?

ÿ

If you are having issues let me know. I can give you a call or walk you through it over text. What number is best for you? 

Erika

Just FYI if you need more time to try FLEX I can skip your next order for you.

Hi Christine,

Checking in because you?ve been a FLEX subscriber for a couple months now (yay!) and I want to upgrade your order to save you $5 every month. 

By upgrading you'll get a 24 pack of FLEX shipped every 3 months for only $45 ($15 per month) instead of having an 8 pack shipped every month for $20. As always shipping is free and you can skip, adjust your frequency, or cancel at anytime. 

Can I upgrade you to help you save next month? Reply Y for yes or N for no and I?ll take care of the rest.

Hi Dayna,

How?s it going?

I saw you cancelled your FLEX membership recently and just wanted to apologize that it didn't work out.

We?ve found that only 33% of people use FLEX successfully within their first cycle. The other 66% of us need up to 2 full boxes.

I?d love to get another box out to you to try and help you through it this time. Can I reactivate your membership? Just reply with Y for yes or N for no and I?ll take care of the rest.

We can do this!

Cheers,
Erika

Hi cierra,

Checking in because you?ve been a FLEX subscriber for a couple months now (yay!) and I want to upgrade your order to save you $5 every month. 

By upgrading you'll get a 24 pack of FLEX shipped every 3 months for only $45 ($15 per month) instead of having an 8 pack shipped every month for $20. As always shipping is free and you can skip, adjust your frequency, or cancel at anytime. 

Can I upgrade you to help you save next month? Reply Y for yes or N for no and I?ll take care of the rest.

As the founder and CEO of The Flex Company, I wanted to share a message because this is the first week of PRIDE.ÿYou are WORTHY of feeling love and being loved EXACTLY AS YOU ARE.ÿNever stop being yourself, no matter how many people try to take you down. The greater you shine the more people may judge, but I'd rather be judged than conform to the ways of people who live in fear of the depth of human experience in all its forms.ÿ



























































This is a month to celebrate the whole of humanity. It's not about sex. It is about remembering all who've come before us who'veÿ been killed for their love and for the rights that Iÿoften take for granted. We've come a long way but still have so far to go. Let's celebrate love and never give up fighting for love. And please please let's all take a moment to remember Stonewall.ÿ???? I'm forever grateful for those who've given (or risked) their lives for our rights. We all need more love in this world. 
If you're struggling with your sexuality, know you're not alone and please don't give up. There's a big world out there and we are waiting for you with open arms. You can do this. 
ÿ
With love, 
Lauren Schulte Wang
Founder & CEO 
The Flex Company

"Bought the felx cup a bit over $45.00 a few days before my period this month.  The first day before my expected period I watched like 5 YouTube videos on how to used and clean my cup. Io learned how to fold and insert in a way that was comfortable for me. P Day .... lol I put it in every thing was fine I checked on it throughout my work day and it was fine second day the same day three trouble ... put in my cup before going to work by the time I get to work I'm removing ,cleaning and reinserting ... one hour later same thing ... 4th day I'm happy I was off messed up my clothes taking it out .   I loved the idea of a the cup but I believe it needs more work for bleeder s like me.",194333
"Bought the flex kit, and I have tried ti every period since September, and it has not worked for me. I have tried all the insertion methods under sun (maybe not) but the cup does not open and I get bad leaks. IT is so frustrating and disappointing. I wanted to love this. I am very very sad, and I would like to return it because it just did not work for me.

"Bought the three month trial a little over a month ago but it did not arrive in time for my last period so I have tried to use it for this months. Although I am 34 and have had two c-sections flex seems to be too big. I can tell where it is supposed to go but no matter what I do I cannot get it to stay where it is supposed to and the edge pops down into my entry. I have been told by a few gynos that I am ""tipped"" or narrow. For my yearly exams they have to use a longer and more narrow tool.

"Bought your disk last night at a Rite Aid drugstore. I thought this was going to help make things better. After getting home I had no issue with the inserting of the product. A few hours later I went to use the restroom and well there was a mess, to say it nicely. So I changed and put a new one in. Taking the first one out wasn't to hard. After going to be at 10pm and having to wake up at 3pm to change it again, since I felt there a leak. Glad I had a pad on also just to be safe. I had a bit of a hard time taking the second one out but finally found it. 

Please tell me this for some one who has a heavy month is this the product I should have used or Is the cup the better idea for me. Im not sure about the cup never tried it. Maybe ive done something wrong and im not sure about it. Please advise. ",281430
"Bow can I cancel the subscription? I like soft disc better. Flex seems to leak. Is it my imagination or is the rim on the flex disc softer. I?ve tried several times and can?t seem to place it correctly.

"Bro I'm 18 I have had my period for 4 years now. I use your discs because there super comfortable and no strings. I've had sex with 2 dudes both not too big, in my whole lifetime. Why does it leak within 2 hours every time. I've definitely put it in the right way,  it wouldn't even sit right any other way. Do you guys plan on making like a wider ring size or a bigger quantity pack to buy.  I would 100% rather buy like 50 discs in one sitting, because 12 discs a period is pointless for me. I have to buy tampons too, and then I may as well skip the disc. Anyways, cool concept for a product just some of my wishes for the future of your company.",190716

I was pretty skeptical when Lauren gave me my first FLEX (I was a lifelong tampon user) but it honestly changed my life.

I promise it won't disappoint and I can't wait to hear what you think!

Hi Stephanie,

I?m Zori, your designated Flexpert!

Things You Should Know About Me

1. There's nothing I love more than parmesan cheese.
2. I got my first period when I was 11. I thought I was prepared for it until it actually happened?I think I cried for about 2 whole hours; the hormones combined with the idea I'd have to deal with blood coming out of an area that was extremely confusing to me at the time for basically the rest of my life freaked me out. Can you tell I was a dramatic kid? 
3. I have a really heavy flow and pretty gnarly cramps. Most months it feels like my vagina/uterus betrayed me, but I power through it because I'm a badass and so are you.
4. My first crush ever was Bill Nye the Science Guy. (Still going strong btw... it's weird, I know, stop judging me please.)

Things I'd love to know about you:

1. What's your go-to tv show or podcast?
2. What's your sign?
3. Do you know whether or not Bill Nye is single?

My First Time Trying FLEX

It was pretty easy, I was scared, but quickly realized that my biggest issue was that I was overthinking it. Once I relaxed and tried it a couple time, I got it to stay in the right spot. Now, I use my FLEX discs on my lighter days, and my Flex Cup on the heavier ones.

Using discs and the cup has completely changed my definition of what TMI means; I used to be very shy, and self-conscious about my body/period. But now, I will literally have a conversation about my vagina just as casually as I'd talk about my foot or arm. I've never felt more empowered to be myself. 

Let me know if you have any questions about using your disc; I've heard it all! Or if you just want to say hello, that's okay too!

Hi,

ÿ

I?m Erika, cofounder of The Flex Company - nice to e-meet you! I hope your Sunday is going well.

ÿ

I don?t usually do this but I peeked at your answers to our quiz and it looks like constantly having to change your tampon or pad during your period (day or night) is a key reason you are looking for an alternative to traditional period products.

ÿ

As you know, changing your tampon or pad every 3 to 4 hours is highly disruptive to your daily schedule ? especially on your heavier flow days. What?s even more frustrating is when you can?t get a good night?s rest for the same reason.

ÿ

One of FLEX?s most appreciated benefits is its 12 hour wear. Not only does FLEX allow you to go through your day with less interruption, but it also allows you to sleep through the night without worry.

ÿ

How would your life be different if you could change your period product no more than 3 times per day?

ÿ

I?d love to get a box out to you so you can try it for yourself.

ÿ

For a limited time, you can click here to claim a 3-month trial of FLEX for only $15 + FREE shipping (that?s 65% OFF the normal trial).

Hi Erica,

Last time we hung out, you might have jumped ship because you were intimidated by Flex. We get it. A menstrual disc looks big. But actually, when pinched in half, it?s just the size of a regular tampon. In fact, 97% of users can?t feel it once in place.

Will you give us another chance to give you the most comfortable period of your life? Use code T77HYU at checkout to get 20% off your next box of Flex Discs when you restart your subscription.

"By the time the box came in I was pretty much done with my period. But I tried to use one anyway to get the sense of what it's like. I feel like my vagina must br shaped weird. Because I got it in and it was resting above my pubic bone but I felt like it wasn't exactly right. Like, my boyfriend is going to be able to feel that during sex. The problem is. I'm in a long distance relationship and we don't get to see one another but once every few months. The next time he comes up I will be on my period and I'm hoping I can get it figured out sort of on the fly. 

Any thoughts or suggestions?

Hi there,

Lauren and I have officially been shipping FLEX for a year and a half (time flies when you?re having fun, huh?) and the feedback from our customers has been incredible.

""I will never go back to tampons, EVER!"" - Alesha

We recently started selling a biodegradable, body-safe pouch to make it easier to remove FLEX without any mess. Because it?s been so life-changing for me, we wanted to offer it to our closest friends and family for free. For two days only, use the code XOXO to get a 3 month trial of FLEX for only $12 + free shipping, and we?ll throw in a free 3 pack of the new pouch. 

You can get your trial here -- the link will go dead in two days.

If you have any questions let me know. Can't wait to hear what you think!

"Can I actually just cancel all together. I have so many now. A surplus. My daughter and I both have tried them for awhile and they just don?t work on us. I leak a lot with them and my daughter just can?t handle touching her own blood. I really like the products and will keep promoting them to my clients. A lot of women like them. They are comfortable to wear. Good luck in the future.

Hi Amy,

Checking in because you?ve been a FLEX subscriber for a couple months now (yay!) and I want to upgrade your order to save you $5 every month.

By upgrading you'll get a 24 pack of FLEX shipped every 3 months for only $45 ($15 per month) instead of having an 8 pack shipped every month for $20. As always shipping is free and you can skip, adjust your frequency, or cancel at anytime.

"Can I ask you some questions about flex? I?m interested in trying it out, but I do have some questions about how it works..

Is it easy to put in? How will I know if I do it right?

Also, since I?ve had kids I find tampons get very uncomfortable, even painful, relatively quickly. Will I have that experience with flex?

How do you empty/remove it? 

Will leaks still happen? Do I have to wear a liner during the day or a pad at night while i sleep? 

Thank you so much for your help!

Hi Melissa,

Checking in because you?ve been a FLEX subscriber for a couple months now (yay!) and I want to upgrade your order to save you $5 every month.

By upgrading you'll get a 24 pack of FLEX shipped every 3 months for only $45 ($15 per month) instead of having an 8 pack shipped every month for $20. As always shipping is free and you can skip, adjust your frequency, or cancel at anytime.

Can I upgrade you to help you save next month? Reply Y for yes or N for no and I?ll take care of the rest.

We just tried to process the $23.99 subscription payment for the fourth time, but unfortunately it failed once again.

You can update your billing information here. (https://click.pstmrk.it/2sm/flexfits.com%2F%3F__pw_iic%3Deaa496a4-915d-4d77-8433-e67bc14fca9d%26at%3D4/lunStSMN/e08F/FtvJPPOQFF/ZHVubmluZy1jb2xsZWN0aW9uLWF0dGVtcHQ) If the next charge fails, your account will be cancelled automatically.

Limited-time only tanks from FLEX.

Tanks that make a powerful statement > everything else.

Especially ones that tell the world you?re doing whatever the f*ck you want while on your period. (Grab your favorite sharpie and write it in directly.)

That includes sex, singing bad karaoke, sipping wine on a beach, running a race, or hanging out with your TV for hours on end.

Hi Victoria!

I'm Helena, your designated Flexpert.

Why We Were Matched Up / My Period Profile

1. I used tampons before switching to FLEX, so I've been in your position and I get what it's like to have to run to the bathroom every 4 hours.
2. I have a medium/average flow and my cycle is predictable unlike my love life.

Things You Should Know About Me

1. I started on my period on my 14th birthday at a bowling alley party.
2. I do a pretty good Cher impersonation.
3. My favorite show is Jane the Virgin.

My First Time Trying Flex

I was really nervous the first time and had to take a few deep breaths, but it was really easy! Now, my first removal was another story. A comical disaster, but lesson learned. Pee before you remove is all I'll say. ;)

If you haven't created your profile yet, just click here (http://trk.klclick.com/wf/click?upn=svW7y3RDpDdu6GOGsz6ToZ4WdFlFE-2BH5dvIz48dzEp85juIQ7xdha5mZbCP9n8JwZGVyLd632GTC1Ux6CWkL8gdjUdoCdaV-2FuZygn5m5snHZzouMxaq4X1geufAZpXRz2o6x2KUprdeGFMnVU1QD9LHmqOaM2jTEriM8iZcdlryyEOC5LyrbPM7CV827WQ87Zf5F92Z-2FdWrgEgA3v8-2FnTg-3D-3D_50QCcmWKsY2nxPz-2BsQP89xNs9hnc3FL4BXT2gQcCRunqpJygV0FSDu183V-2BXskWhZs6jppUFjTxKnM3txESIY9QMQeJMdqff3MgY-2FuKo6HzcOGd7KjXkokknufxMiqAu68-2F9PQhIw7s8PKuuFF6a2V4lt-2B65ZEhYVW3D-2FsQt8Gg8lhdFN4ozr-2BK4kwUyufGTEvL2RGFeHQPcq9wOn3w6y522ZMVclA0YUtFnYUF4Lr10TjJ-2BcRwhyEXtPkcrY0FnOvrXd5EyRJQdbaGGxZeeQb96jLDLtzcMgkl-2F-2FT1dJYXL1piJKiVCw8Vv0YemILK1a93hZr1olKzn-2FugmK674mzHXanR7IHpLpMsqRqWEJfCPX6HyCaYawOTSUkhGGTWSvNXi7QGOQwc3DUwP33299w-3D-3D)  to get started. It's a great way to customize your experience.

Want to chat about FLEX?  Or maybe just say hi? Ask me anything (nothing is TMI).

Happy to be helping you from the other side of the bathroom,

Helena

Hello Kathleen,

I'm Helena, your designated Flexpert.

Trying FLEX can seem daunting, even a little intimidating at first. But I wanted to let you know that you're not alone. I've been there and use FLEX myself so please consider me a guide through the trial process.

A little about me...

1. My friends and family live for my character impressions - from Cher, to Julia Childs, to Lois from Family Guy.
2. I'm addicted to true crime everything - books, podcasts, shows. Not on my watch! ;)
3. On a Friday night, you'll find me having a glass of wine, binging one of my fave shows, and snuggling with my sweet pup, Willie.

My Period Profile

1. I started my period on my 14th birthday at a bowling alley party.
2. I've tried pads, tampons, period panties, cups. I've done it all!
3. I have a medium flow and my cycle is predictable - unlike my love life.

My First Time Trying Flex

I was really nervous and had to take a few deep breaths, but it was way easier than I thought it would be. Now, my first removal was another story. A comical disaster, but lesson learned. Pee before you remove is all I'll say. ;)

Want to chat about FLEX? Or maybe just say hey? Ask me anything - I've heard it all (nothing is TMI).

Hi Shalandria,

I?m reaching out to let you know that your next shipment will include a three month supply of FLEX (24 discs).

We sent you an email about a subscription plan change by mistake.
I?m personally reaching out to let you know that we mistakenly sent an email stating that we were changing your subscription from a quarterly plan (24 discs every three months) to a monthly plan (8 discs every month).  

We are a young, fast-growing business and certainly not without our technical glitches. But we can admit when we?ve messed up. I apologize for sending the wrong email. Your plan has not changed.

You subscribed to a quarterly plan.
For ongoing orders you will receive the subscription you signed up for: a three month supply of FLEX (24 discs). Your product will be shipped and your credit card charged once every three months - 24 discs for $45. There?s no change in price per month ($15).

I?m taking $5 off your next order.
If you?re cool with business as usual (sticking to your quarterly plan), I will automatically take $5 off your next order.

Too many? Too few? Let us know if you want to change your plan.
If you would like to change your current plan, I?d be happy to help you. Just reply to this email and I can customize the quantity and timing of your next shipment.  

Otherwise there?s no further action required of you other than to enjoy your $5 off and another insanely comfortable period.

In solidarity,

Erika",35220

Hi Rachel,

We have some great news for you! We?ve heard from our customers that $45 charged quarterly can be cost prohibitive so we?ve updated our subscription to be charged monthly to help offset the cost.

There is no action required for you. Once your trial period is over, you?ll automatically be switched over to an 8 pack shipped and billed monthly at $15. This change will be reflected on your account page within 48 hours. If you need more than 8 discs per month let us know and we?ll hook you up.

Our goal at The Flex Company is to deliver life changing period products to everyone. We?re constantly working to fulfill that mission and want to make sure you always have FLEX on hand when you need it.

Thank you for being such an awesome customer.

Thanks,

Hi there,

I wanted to share a special offer for loyal FLEX customers. For a limited time, you can get a subscription upgrade and save $16 on your next order.

Here?s how it works: Moving forward, we?ll send you a 3-month supply of FLEX (24 discs for $29) instead of a one-month supply (8 discs for $15). That?s the same number of discs for $16 less. 

By shipping every three months, we can cut down waste over 60% and save on shipping costs, which means we can pass those savings along to you. As always, shipping is included and you can skip, adjust your frequency, or cancel anytime.

Just reply ?Y? for yes to this email, and I?ll apply the $16 discount for all of your upcoming orders.

Cheers, 
Merissa",47257

Feeling nervous?

1. Always wash your hands. And take a deep breath. You've got this!

2. Start on a lighter day. Try your first FLEX on a lighter flow day, when you have some time to spare. So not when you?re at Coachella, on a 6-hour car ride, or when your flow is already Niagara Falls.

3. It may get a little messy. But not as messy as you might think. The average woman only menstruates about 1.5 tsp in 12 hrs. Just make sure to sit and keep your FLEX parallel to the floor as you remove it.

4. Wear a liner for backup. You shouldn?t need it once you get it down. But for your first time or two, it can?t hurt to have a contingency while you?re out and about, for a little peace of mind.

5. Push it back and down. Your FLEX will slide in easily. But as it does, keep it at an angle, all the way back and down behind the pubic bone, to ensure it covers fully around the base of your cervix.

6. Make sure you can?t feel it. If you can feel your FLEX inside you, that?s a good sign it?s not all the way in. I know this sounds weird, but when it?s inserted properly, you won?t even notice it?s there.

7. You can always adjust or re-insert. If it feels not quite right or like it?s leaking, try adjusting your FLEX while it?s inside you by pushing it farther down and back, or just take it out, empty it and try again.

8. Seeing blood when you pee (or poop) is normal. When you bear down on your pelvic muscles, your FLEX?s front edge may slide out from behind your pubic bone, letting some fluid out. This is nothing to worry about. Just make sure it?s tucked back into place when you?re done.

9. Pretend to poop to help remove. If you have trouble removing your FLEX, bear down on your pelvic muscles as if taking a poop. The front edge will pop out from behind your pubic bone, so it?s easier to reach.

10. Wait to remove it after sex. Vaginas can expand up to 200% during sex. As you can imagine, this might make your FLEX hard to remove. Give it at least 15min after sex so your vagina can return to size.


Give it a try and let us know what you think,

Erika

Hi Alicia,

We have some great news for you! We?ve heard from our customers that $45 charged quarterly can be cost prohibitive so we?ve updated our subscription to be charged monthly to help offset the cost.

There is no action required for you. Once your trial period is over, you?ll automatically be switched over to an 8 pack shipped and billed monthly at $15. This change will be reflected on your account page within 48 hours. If you need more than 8 discs per month let us know and we?ll hook you up.

Our goal at The Flex Company is to deliver life changing period products to everyone. We?re constantly working to fulfill that mission and want to make sure you always have FLEX on hand when you need it.

Thank you for being such an awesome customer.

You just joined the club. Now what?

Learn how to best use the FLEX Disc so this relationship can thrive.

1. Ok, let's get in position.

Positioning is key: sit over the toilet, stand with a leg up, or get into a squat. All of these different ways work, it?s just a matter of trying and seeing which one works best for your body. When you?re comfortable, insert the disc into your vagina.

2. Pinch it, please

Pinch the disc in half (it may look big, but once pinched it?s as small as a tampon).

3. Get ready to insert

CONSIDER THIS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART: Because FLEX is different than a tampon, insertion is different too.

Point the disc downwards and push the edge that goes in first toward the floor. You want the disc to sit at a vertical angle and cover your full cervix.

4. Placement for comfort

Make sure the rim of the Disc is tucked above your pubic bone. You shouldn?t be able to feel it, if it?s in the right place.

5. Wear, sleep, eat, repeat.

12-hour wear means you can do whatever you want. We?ve got you covered.

6. Ready to remove?

Clean your hands first. Remove your disc second. Take a seat or stand with a leg up. Slide your finger under the front edge and pull down, keeping parallel to the floor.

7. Disposal

Once you?re done, turn the disc upside down in the toilet to empty the fluid. Place it in a wrapper and in the trash. Ta-da! You?re done.

Still curious about the process? Peep our pro tips and helpful vid.

So I think the rubber will be better. Are they just as flexible? How long does it take to ship? I live in Tennessee.

Hi Kay,

I?m reaching out to let you know that your next shipment will include a three month supply of FLEX (24 discs).

We sent you an email about a subscription plan change by mistake.
I?m personally reaching out to let you know that we mistakenly sent an email stating that we were changing your subscription from a quarterly plan (24 discs every three months) to a monthly plan (8 discs every month).  

We are a young, fast-growing business and certainly not without our technical glitches. But we can admit when we?ve messed up. I apologize for sending the wrong email. Your plan has not changed.

You subscribed to a quarterly plan.
For ongoing orders you will receive the subscription you signed up for: a three month supply of FLEX (24 discs). Your product will be shipped and your credit card charged once every three months - 24 discs for $45. There?s no change in price per month ($15).

I?m taking $5 off your next order.
If you?re cool with business as usual (sticking to your quarterly plan), I will automatically take $5 off your next order.

Too many? Too few? Let us know if you want to change your plan.
If you would like to change your current plan, I?d be happy to help you. Just reply to this email and I can customize the quantity and timing of your next shipment.  

Otherwise there?s no further action required of you other than to enjoy your $5 off and another insanely comfortable period.

In solidarity,

Erika

The Emotional Rollercoaster That Is Trying a Menstrual Disc for The First Time.

 

SCROLL AWAY

? You saw an ad for the first time

? What the? Wait. WHAT? How?!

? Learning that tampons were invented by a man in the 1930s

? ...and then all the sudden you're woke and order the trial

? FLEX arrives and you see how big it is

? But you think f*** it, LET'S DO THIS

? When you open it for the first time and it flies out of the package

? You finally wrangle one and put it in

? But you're too nervous to let it go because you think it's going to be lost forever

? And then you finally do and you can't feel it at all

? Then you realize you're not supposed to feel it and start to think F*** TAMPONS

? You pee for the first time with a menstrual disc in and there's blood in the toilet bowl

? And you're like oh my god it's leaking

? But you realize that's normal, too, and go about your day

? You completely forget you're even on your period

? Even your cramps are gone!

? You remove it for the first time thinking...

? But remember the shower tip and it's a breeze.

? You throw away all your tampons.

? And live happily ever after with a new outlook on life: I can conquer anything.

Hi Geneva,

 

We are excited to share that we have changed our name from Softcup to Softdisc! Same amazing product, same great benefits, brand new name.

 

For those of you who have been long time customers of Softcup, you know that the product has seen many different names over the years from Instead, to Instead Softcup, to Softcup. Watch this video (http://softdisc.com/2018/04/02/softcup-becomes-softdisc/) to learn why we changed our name.

 

Other exciting news- with our name change comes a brand new website complete with store locator, how-to-videos, FAQs, and so much more.

Stay tuned for more news about Softdisc.

Hi ! I?m Merissa, your designated Flexpert.

Why We Were Matched Up / My Period Profile

1. I used to use a menstrual cup, which gave me lots-o-extra time but ended up being painful and needy. FLEX gave me my life back without the hurt - I actually can?t feel it at all. 
2. I have a really heavy flow (I fill a super tampon in 1-3 hours) and cramps that felt like a mosh pit in my stomach.

Things You Should Know About Me

1. I started my period when I was 10 at a waterpark and was so confused! My mom wasn?t there and my dad got to handle it (like a champ, might I add).
2. I?m an avid runner and love being outside - movement is everything.
3. I grew up in a super small town. It has a population of just over 3,000, most of which are my family.

My First Time Trying FLEX

I tried FLEX on my heaviest day and found what looked like a war-zone in my chonies. Yes, leaks can happen while you're getting used to FLEX. But I?m now enjoying the most comfortable, leak-free period of my life! <3

Want to chat about FLEX?  Or maybe just say hi?

Hey there ,

This is Zori from The Flex Company. I wanted to check and see how your period is treating you. If skipping sex because of your period is still a thing, the FLEX Disc can really help. One of our most-loved benefits is that the disc lets you have all kinds of mess-free period sex. It lets you get it on without getting out the Tide pen.

Hi there,

As your Flexpert, my job is to answer any questions you have about periods, period products and even my favorite topic, The Bachelor (no spoilers!). Today we could chat about heavy flows.

On average, people with a heavy flow will change their pad or tampon 5+ times per day, and sometimes still have some leakage.

FLEX is different.

Even people with the heaviest flows only have to change FLEX once every 12 hours. That?s because FLEX can hold up to five tampons' worth of fluid. Plus, you don?t have to worry about leaking. Our ComfortSeal? design forms to the shape of your body to create a leak-proof seal.

Try FLEX now (http://the-flex-company-1.trk.klaviyomail.com/wf/click?upn=gE02jo8QEQs-2FEOLihAE5V53Bckb9X6T9gnyvtGZLgYPQ8ydCbzfnMWgcOWFW3OEiBifYxQfzDFsgxDdTVp7YLcYDwFhLbFoCMwav1eaYg0g0crG92PWcBJ2oUpJM-2F6PDLClCLLZPxX5gJbJ5DNaAe9JZ9ytiZFRc6QMjEz8TSMBa23A7MQrT6w0MPg2nPtB6PrJzMtFu-2F53kx33abDGx-2FETJKxhRx6JfenZBT6r8OZArcIMTMEeBGLxG3ULoBUAI_mMHV4BeRLIX82aTDHPp-2B49Bwm-2FmhOJypcKr61epXIHXahqipJIyLp2XR8nCQPsoABEnggO7XzlsCq97zNqjZH5WSvnmrTELoml3ZgGcudkXwXnoWVXpgse2Aevo-2FT-2BZbaTvUkYEa7teIGR4IbqXLQJbt23u5tz7vtBeb-2BrIUARwmYHRRCJdJbXFCzwrbJp1cQI-2FoysEvn0HP7fNRB0gQtuSwx0UCy-2BRzHtoND-2FrAb-2FomEBsF13mmsIjAtCPFoEyEjAP1A9qlODCiwcmWNVG4coBdHXiJGUrxo5ah7l5ls9h3xEl1OAAw2CgFf4feIWRouwfHoMflhHUX7fzzWy3YGnhsNXIWmgxoOxOZwWGkeQw-3D) to experience the difference for yourself.

Hi Haley,

Lauren and I have officially been shipping FLEX for a year and a half (time flies when you?re having fun, huh?) and the feedback from our customers has been incredible.

""I will never go back to tampons, EVER!"" - Alesha

We recently started selling a biodegradable, body-safe pouch to make it easier to remove FLEX without any mess. Because it?s been so life-changing for me, we wanted to offer it to our closest friends and family for free. Today only, use the code XOXO to get a 3 month trial of FLEX for only $12 + free shipping, and we?ll throw in a free 3 pack of the new pouch.

You can get your trial here<http://the-flex-company-1.trk.klaviyomail.com/wf/click?upn=gE02jo8QEQs-2FEOLihAE5V53Bckb9X6T9gnyvtGZLgYOQcTMYl38LpDL8-2FzhcCIygd6ceiRnX4pQjrbMJFYUdqiHPq7ERB8-2BAVkZNhShIjL69RpsUW-2BKdQ0M2uRm5bHEYB-2FEc0djJuANKvrivXvijy9FQjrz444hGEck6pyc0HrRBR97JcdrlVDNjo6rfi7ccBIE96Fg3uRSFevGv4D-2BBMBDGjX21W0v1Lqp9-2FRzIDzC21IbAfJWk9I-2B1uvFRk-2BuKpjA8oXgS6z2fxW7zHiLS9v7hKxW6Q6ZbJywy-2BpMsFATIZ-2BeDv-2B64hg5xDphfDxlZ57k-2F8qZWDu9Rl8BUr69oLLz2UXWiGSuhkMAxnsuIccI-3D_4Kof8KSwuTfLbRY59RU59cW0vgendT8G75irQ37j0S-2FewWunx95n6n3ofiud1vN37KkCUJbcVkfZytVoRhtifpS09r0G-2FqB9SEAwljvl-2BEXrARqDuK7IHllKVTOKkE8KlYK1KuFCG9HeV-2FimeQHjmFDBT-2BlAATC440nuG921RTHvTYfbI0IgrpAahFH9sTU5BjMcZyD-2F61RZ8BJ-2F-2F0Kfl0Tt-2FtfigIPC6OBc9pC1hH6uykCHBjxZHFgWjbXyUhe2P7yA9V762psMHNTsk8Nlumj8l8uDMc70lq-2FJaGArTIm8IPpkN-2BN-2FIL7LGUxaxYxVrG2XYE8yigb7vvGnLjuE6o1amf0UIEVUbU6nkwCaSNU-3D> -- the link will go dead today.

Hi Rachel,

Checking in because you?ve been a FLEX subscriber for a while now (yay!) and I want to upgrade your order to make your payments only $11/month.

By upgrading you'll get a 24 pack of FLEX shipped every 3 months for only $11 per month, charged annually ($135/year). You'll be saving $45/year -- that's 3 months of FLEX for free! As always shipping is free and you can adjust your shipments at anytime.

 

Can I upgrade you to help you save next year? Reply Y for yes or N for no and I?ll take care of the rest.

Hi Gabriella! I?m Merissa, your designated Flexpert.

Why We Were Matched Up / My Period Profile

1. I used to use a menstrual cup, which gave me lots-o-extra time but ended up being painful and needy. FLEX gave me my life back without the hurt - I actually can?t feel it at all. 
2. I have a really heavy flow (I fill a super tampon in 1-3 hours) and cramps that felt like a mosh pit in my stomach.

Things You Should Know About Me

1. I started my period when I was 10 at a waterpark and was so confused! My mom wasn?t there and my dad got to handle it (like a champ, might I add).
2. I?m an avid runner and love being outside - movement is everything.
3. I grew up in a super small town. It has a population of just over 3,000, most of which are my family.

My First Time Trying FLEX

I tried FLEX on my heaviest day and found what looked like a war-zone in my chonies. Yes, leaks can happen while you're getting used to FLEX. But I?m now enjoying the most comfortable, leak-free period of my life! <3

Hi Marlana,


I?m Erika, cofounder of The Flex Company - nice to e-meet you!

I wanted to personally welcome you to the Flex family. We?re on a mission to create body-positive, life-changing experiences through the products that we make and the conversations that we spark. Our vision is to reimagine and deliver life-changing period products everywhere. Thank you for helping us get there.

You?ve now committed to a 90 day challenge to change the way you live life during your period. During that time I?m going to send you 10 emails which will:

* Give you transparency into our team and our products
* Teach you how to use a menstrual disc
* Lay out the common pain points & how to work through them
* Provide you access to a real person (her name is Kate) for additional help
* Give you ideas on what to do with all the time you?ll get back
* Teach you a bit more about how FLEX measures up against tampons
* Notify you of your upcoming charge & shipment

Until then be patient with yourself, try to have a little fun and know that I?m here whenever you need me. We?re in this together now.

Cheers,

Erika

Hello Kasey,

I'm Helena, your designated Flexpert.

Trying FLEX can seem daunting, even a little intimidating at first. But I wanted to let you know that you're not alone. I've been there and use FLEX myself so please consider me a guide through the trial process.

A little about me...

1. My friends and family live for my character impressions - from Cher, to Julia Childs, to Lois from Family Guy.
2. I'm addicted to true crime everything - books, podcasts, shows. Not on my watch! ;)
3. On a Friday night, you'll find me having a glass of wine, binging one of my fave shows, and snuggling with my sweet pup, Willie.

My Period Profile

1. I started my period on my 14th birthday at a bowling alley party.
2. I've tried pads, tampons, period panties, cups. I've done it all!
3. I have a medium flow and my cycle is ",
