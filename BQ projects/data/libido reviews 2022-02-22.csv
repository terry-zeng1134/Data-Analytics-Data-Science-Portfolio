The reason is: These vitamins are simply AMAZING to say the least. My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 2 years, and the biggest problem in our relationship was our sex life. It almost seemed like he didn't care for it at all! He's constantly grabbing my breasts, playing with them, smacks my butt as I walk by, compliments me day and night, but when it came to sex he was always unmotivated... he'd either be too tired, or just hard to turn on. No matter what I did or wore, I'd talk sexy, wear sexy outfits, touch him, and NOTHING. We have had sex once a week, if not every two weeks since the beginning of our relationship and This was the usual, but sex is so important to me that it was becoming an issue. Well, one month on these and as of 10 minutes ago we've had sex 3 times in 6 DAYS. We've NEVER done this!! I'm so happy I'm a bit emotional. He proposed to me a few months back and these vitamins have made our relationship so much more solid and just better. I thank this product so much, I have no words."

Unfortunately a few days after taking it I started having a reaction. Red, itchy, swollen joints (knees, elbows, hands) and splotches on my arms and neck. I didn't initially think it was the supplement as I had already been taking it a few days before it happened, but the next day about 30 minutes after taking it the same thing happened. I stopped taking it and it hasn't happened since. I have no allergies so I'm unsure what caused the reaction.

I did not see any change in my libido but I couldn't take it any longer to find out if it would work for me the longer I took it....

It didn't happen every day (not even at the same time of day) I took the vitamin... so it was quite confusing. It was not a just slight flushing, which I've seen Rae mention in IG comments... it was very similar to an allergic reaction. For nearly an hour my lips, eyes, and face swelled to the point you could see every pore, my face/neck/chest/upper arms became radiating hot, painful burning, red, and itchy. I went to my doctor because benadryl wasn't working and I was nervous about the (at the time, unknown) reaction possibly eventually affecting my mouth/airways. All these ""allergic reaction"" symptoms stopped a few days after I stopped taking In The Mood. I wish there was a disclaimer about this on their website or the vitamin.

My husband realized how much I was struggling with birth control and decided to get snipped. I was able to stop taking BC, but still didn't feel quite right months after. Through some patient and analytical conversations with the hubsters, really narrowed down why I had a hard time with intimacy. We noticed stress and anxiety being key factors. **Review** I have been taking ""In the Moods"" pills for the last 3 months, and have felt a significant change. I take these pills, plus the ""Beauty Pills"" and Smarty Pants women's multivitamin. I do feel my stress levels aren't at their breaking point, and my anxiety about my body and sex have relaxed. It's not an instant, ""Hey Baby"" pull your pants off type of horniess, but more a willingness to let myself enjoy the situation without pull of responsibility and mental exhaustion I was feeling before I started taking the vitamins."

I noticed that my mood was more cheerful and I felt less heavy while taking. Also found I enjoyed intimate moments with my husband so much more. It's not an obvious change but I noticed I had more good days. More energy and all that allowed me to enjoy myself. Also something I wasn't aware of but makes the pills more enjoyable is the touch of peppermint oils as you take it. Feels luxurious!

To be honest I spent a big chunk of my life thinking there was something wrong with me because I never had that desire or craving for sex like most teens and young adults do. It put a huge strain on my 10 year relationship, understandably so. I saw these vitamins in a Facebook ad and decided it wouldn't hurt to do some research. After reading many positive reviews, I thought, may as well give it a try. And I am so so glad I took a chance on this company. These vitamins have changed my life. I have been taking them for one month, and just reordered and set up a monthly shipment. I actually have a sex drive and a desire to have sex with my husband. For the first time in my entire life, and that is not an exaggeration. THANK YOU RAE WELLNESS!!!"

I stopped taking them and within days I started clearing up (drinking tons of water) So i'm not sure if it was because I was taking two different types at one time or what. I've taken other detoxes and vitamins before and never had this kind of reaction. I was super bummed though because I've been on a desperate search to help my drive. But I guess this wasn't it. But I took the chance because of the low price point. So I guess I'd say take the chance if you'd like.

It was like I KNOW I am very attracted to my husband, but literally nothing could really make me crave sex or seek it out. My body would, also, refuse to orgasm and it was awful. I tried to come off the medication for this very reason, but my mental health took a dive and it was decided my sex drive wasn't more important than my overall sanity. This was a last ditch effort to find a solution. It has taken a few weeks of taking them every morning, but for the first time since I don't know when, I have a major sex drive again and am able to cross the finish line. Though my husband has been more than understanding and has never guilted next about the medications hindering my desires, it makes me unbelievably happy to be able to show just how attractive and desirable I find him again. Thank you, Rae, for giving me back my passion and adding that missing spark back into my life. If you are antidepressants, give these a try. It isn't a cure all, but if it worked for me then there is a great chance if can work for you (I am on 300mg Welbutrin, 20mg Citalopram, 30mg Vyvanse - struggle with severe clinical depressant and generalized anxiety disorder along with other things but those are the two main tree trucks of the issues.). Give it a try and give it TIME to work. Take it for at least 6-8 weeks (I saw results within 3). Good luck!"

I\'d guess the L-arginine also helps because a lot of us suffer from some flavor of POTS or tachycardia so anything to help us regulate our blood pressure and heartrates/heart rhythm. I enjoy the bump of caffeine as I take it pre-food in the morning.

I was hit by the energy after just 2 hours and was free of anxiety and stress for the rest of the night. I don't know if it was in my head but whatever happened it worked! Sadly I haven't felt the same since I started taking them. I'm hoping after a week it will build up and give me the same effects.

Yes and no. I wasn't sure what to expect, but my results, over the course of two months, have been wonderful! I saw a difference within a week, but I wanted to wait to give a review based on a longer period of time. I'm ""in the mood"" often, about 4 out of the 7 days a week, physically able and ready... and this is coming from never having desire of my own (not exaggerating). After I had kids at a younger age of 19 and 21, my hormone balance altered and I lost a lot of physical ability to be ""in the mood"", which led to frustration and ultimately, no desire. Does this pill make you over the top, feel like sexy-time 100% of the time?... no. But I give it 5 stars because the results deserve it. I'm thrilled to have found this effective way to encourage closeness in my marriage, and my husband obviously appreciates it! I'm doubly glad that it's an all-natural supplement and not a prescription. I signed up for the monthly subscription just because I didn't want to forget to re-supply and be without it. I know every body is different, but I would strongly suggest a gal give it a try if you are struggling in this area! :heart:️"

However, when I received mine in the mail, the tamper seal was opened and one of the pill capsules had a hole in it that had spilled out and gotten the powder all over the other pills, making it have a horrible taste everytime I did take them, which is especially hard for me since I have a hard time swallowing pills due to a sensitive gag reflex already."

Well after a few days taking them I started noticing a shift, feeling a bit more like my old self in those regards. Honestly, that is exactly what I wanted!!

The reviews were too good to pass up. I impressed and happy with the results. I noticed right away that I had more energy- which is half the problem of being ""in the mood"" after a day at work and parenting. For example, I took them late in the day yesterday because I forgot in the morning, I had so much energy I cleaned the whole house til about 10pm! This never happens. Hubby came home and couldn't believe how much I had accomplished! Normally by 8pm I am crashed out! As for the other benefits, I definitely notice an increase in that. It has thrown my cycle off but I have had zero PMS symptoms so far. I haven't noticed being less stressed but I have noticed less anxiety in general. I am in my early 40s.

BUY THESE. Your libido is going to be low if your hormones aren’t balanced. These 100% balanced my hormones (along with a low carb/high fat diet).

Increased energy and my mood is so much happier too. Definitely worth trying.

When I first received my package I already loved the aesthetic of the packaging. Beautiful colors, loved the font and the bottle that the pills came in. When you open the bottle the capsules smelled like mint. They're not too big and VERY EASY to swallow. After a week I started noticing something different. All my brain fog was gone, I had more energy and I was ""in the mood"" a lot more. And let me tell you, for some odd reason I stopped being in the mood for awhile. Not because I wasn't attracted to my husband but more of I just never had the feeling of wanting to have sex. I thought it was weird considering I just turned 28 and my doctor was no help because after getting all of these tests done she said that I was fine. So this company basically saved my sex life and because of it I've already ordered so many of Rae's other products and have put myself on their subscription list!"

I was desperate for some kind of help, saw an ad for these, read some reviews, and impulsively bought a batch because I figured there was nothing to lose. Maybe it's a coincidence or placebo effect, but even so... these were a game changer for me! I began working out at the beginning of the year and these give me a nice boost of energy and mental clarity to stay on track with exercising.

I found this and my husband purchased for a Valentine's Day gift. On day 2 while doing a mundane house chore it was like all the sudden someone turned a light switch on. Like a subtle desire or interest and as each day has passed it has grown. At first I thought maybe it's the placebo effect but who cares and now I can tell it's really working, within several hours of taking in the morning I can tell it's working. Didn't want to leave a review in Fb for all my friends and colleagues to see but wanted other people to know that it works. the cost is minimal which I'm grateful for but to me this has been worth so much more to make me feel like a woman again and for my husband to feel wanted again."

It was like I KNOW I am very attracted to my husband, but literally nothing could really make me crave sex or seek it out. My body would, also, refuse to orgasm and it was awful. I tried to come off the medication for this very reason, but my mental health took a dive and it was decided my sex drive wasn't more important than my overall sanity. This was a last ditch effort to find a solution. It has taken a few weeks of taking them every morning, but for the first time since I don't know when, I have a major sex drive again and am able to cross the finish line. Though my husband has been more than understanding and has never guilted next about the medications hindering my desires, it makes me unbelievably happy to be able to show just how attractive and desirable I find him again. Thank you, Rae, for giving me back my passion and adding that missing spark back into my life. If you are antidepressants, give these a try. It isn't a cure all, but if it worked for me then there is a great chance if can work for you (I am on 300mg Welbutrin, 20mg Citalopram, 30mg Vyvanse - struggle with severe clinical depressant and generalized anxiety disorder along with other things but those are the two main tree trucks of the issues.).

I was desperate for some kind of help, saw an ad for these, read some reviews, and impulsively bought a batch because I figured there was nothing to lose. Maybe it's a coincidence or placebo effect, but even so... these were a game changer for me! I began working out at the beginning of the year and these give me a nice boost of energy and mental clarity to stay on track with exercising.

I did not see any change in my libido but I couldn't take it any longer to find out if it would work for me the longer I took it.... I was having an apparently normal but adverse reaction to the amount of B3/Niacin (possibly due to combining this with the multivitamin?). It didn't happen every day (not even at the same time of day) I took the vitamin... so it was quite confusing. It was not a just slight flushing, which I've seen Rae mention in IG comments... it was very similar to an allergic reaction. For nearly an hour my lips, eyes, and face swelled to the point you could see every pore, my face/neck/chest/upper arms became radiating hot, painful burning, red, and itchy. I went to my doctor because benadryl wasn't working and I was nervous about the (at the time, unknown) reaction possibly eventually affecting my mouth/airways. All these ""allergic reaction"" symptoms stopped a few days after I stopped taking In The Mood. I wish there was a disclaimer about this on their website or the vitamin. I nor my doctor NEVER considered B3 was the culprit to what was happening until I saw a random comment from a stranger on Instagram."

I REALLY did. I had an emergency hysterectomy at 24 years old. The procedure greatly impacted my sex life &basically left it nonexistent. It's remained that way for almost 10 years now. It's frustrating & embarrassing, especially for my marriage & my age. Thank God I have an understanding husband. My hysterectomy also caused me to have constant, horrible acne. So 2 years ago after trying almost everything that my dermatologist knew of & not having any positive results. We opted for ""accutane"". It wasn't the best to experience during the process, but I haven't had a single pimple/zit since I completed the regimen. Until I started taking these. My face broke out, badly & by process of elimination, we discovered it was because of these pills. I stopped taking them & skin is back to being clear again. I know my situation is unique. So I'm not bashing this product. It just wasn't a good fit for me. The hunt to find a fix for my ""mood"" is now back on."

Green coffee bean is the same caffeine source that’s in a Starbucks Refresher. There’s other ingredients in the supplement that can cause insomnia. I find these work best when I take around dinner time with food or no more (!!!) than 4 hours before I plan on going to bed. They do make me a little jittery due to the caffeine but I have ADHD so the jitters don’t really bother me. The Maca-root extract works wonders for me and my libido. I love how I don’t have to taste the Maca unlike the powder where I would have to mix it and it was still clumpy and hard to drink.

Hubby came home and couldn't believe how much I had accomplished! Normally by 8pm I am crashed out! As for the other benefits, I definitely notice an increase in that.

I figured that when buying these, but I'm super happy with them so far and I'll definitely be buying them every month! I recommend anyone who stumbles across these supplements, finds themselves reading these reviews, to just buy them and try them out!!"

I’m a 31 year old woman who’s sex drive had completely crashed. Compared to my 20s my sex life is non-existent. I’m currently in a loving relationship of three years and I couldn’t remember the last time we had sex. So, I thought it was time to be pro active about bringing “spice” back into our relationship. Upon opening the bottle I was shocked at how huge the pills were! I wanted to feel the effect immediately so I took the recommended dose of 4. After an hour had passed I was disappointed because I didn’t feel any different. After about 2.5 hours....oh boy! It definitely works ladies! I highly recommend this product.

I've been a fan of theirs for a long time but once they started putting 25-26-28 as are quantities in a bottle I looked for another option. I do like the quality I do like the pills but I sort of resent them skimping so that one bottle can't last you a month I think that's just to peculiar peculiar thing to do.

For years I’ve struggled with random abdomen pain, diarrhea, constipation, and bloating. I thought it was my diet and because I felt so bad at times, I would fast until the pain went away. This was a pretty miserable existence until I started taking probiotics. The Olly Probiotics work about as well as other probiotics I’ve used and only requires you to take one capsule. The capsules are easy to swallow, didn’t have any adverse effect on my system, and seemed to work as they are supposed to. Each capsule contains 10 billion CFUs of probiotics, and apparently is a good blend for vaginal flora.  It's a lot lower CFU than my normal probiotic (I usually take a 30 CFU blend) but I didn't have any issues with the lower CFU count.  If you require a strong probiotic, you may want to consider a different blend.  There is also no indication that these are gluten free, vegetarian, or lactose free, so if you're allergic, I would avoid.  One pet peeve about this particular supplement is that the packaging is extremely wasteful.  I was able to fit all the pills in the lid of this bottle (there is a gap in the lid in the photo, so half are under the small plastic shelf), and given than there's only 25 capsules, you don't even have a full month's supply per bottle.  Overall, this is a decent probiotic, but I will likely stick with my regular brand just based on pricing and for the more eco-friendly packaging.  That said, this is a solid probiotic that I would take if offered. "

That week, everything down there got off balance and this supplement wasn’t effective in keeping or restoring balance to my pH. I might as well have been taking nothing at all. Which makes me wonder if it was really even doing anything the rest of the month. Who knows, but its performance alone during my period when I needed it most, is enough for me to be done with this supplement for good. In addition to the formula not working for me, the container is also a pain. It’s hard to flip open and the whole cap comes off every time. Everything about this supplement feels gimmicky to me now…the immature name, the candy dispenser, the claims. It’s lost my trust. I don’t recommend this product to anyone struggling to keep their vaginal pH in balance. Total waste of time. "

I went online (target, Amazon) to read reviews and found similar complaints. Wish I would’ve researched before and not after. My take away from this is to just be careful with trusting man made products to “change” our lives. When in fact all we need is more rest, more water, more exercise, and a new diet. "

There are no funky smell on the capsule and they are easy to swallow. I took 2 capsules per suggested and had the problems mentioned above. Not sure if it cause it but that’s the only medication I took so I know exactly how my body reacts. Took it for 3 days and stopped after that.

Lol I still haven't experienced any other negative effects like I did in the beginning and I take 2 of these every morning like clockwork. Everyone is going to be different but for me, this stuff has been a life/marriage saver. Update 1- Over 2 weeks of taking it now and the headaches have subsided. I've changed from 3* to 5* because of that and because, while I haven't experienced increased desire, I have experienced increased sensation. Also natural lubrication production has increased. No irritability, no gas, no bad effects apart from headaches the first week. Def will keep taking this. Original- Several days now and no results. I do know it can take some time to build up in your system and what not, but I've had weird headaches since my second day. Not sure if I'm stick to taking them because of that. They also smell and I had difficulty swallowing them because of that. But I'll try and stick it out and update if anything happens. "

I wish it contained more than 25 pills in the bottle, but so far it has been doing a wonderful job. I haven't experienced any side effects or reactions and my BV has not returned.

I'd tried ashwaghanda as well more so as a relaxant to relieve stress and anxiety, but didn't see much help with it so I just slacked off of that one. The dose of maca in these caps is lower than what I take of my plain maca. When I take these in conjunction with my plain maca, I do see a little bit of change in my moods and libido for the better. When i take these caps by themselves, I don't see much. So, I think these may work for some, and may not work for others... as with any supplement. If you already use maca by itself, I think these caps can be a nice boost to add on. "

There small and easy to swallow, about the same size as an Advil or Tylenol gel. These pills claim to balance your pH which is one of the reasons I sometimes get yeast infections. So far while I’ve been taking these I haven’t had any issues and it’s been a couple weeks. The only downside is I wish a container came with more than 25 pills if I’m supposed to take these daily.

I did not notice a change. These pills don't have that awful plastic taste, but they are a little difficult to swallow. I usually have issues with the larger pills though. I still managed and was very hopeful. So many reviewers said they saw a change. I had a bit more energy the first few days, but I think it was just in my head. It didn't last past the first week. Now aside from the lack of positive effects, I can honestly tell you I had no side effects from them. No headaches, nothing. I didn't mind giving them a try at all. The container is really cute, and I am using it for some craft storage. I usually have very good experiences with the Olly brand, but this one was a miss for me. Nothing against it, but I didn't have any benefits. I would honestly say to give them a try because the possible benefits would be worth the cost. No side effects, so just the cost of the pills. Plenty of other reviewers had a great experience, I just wish I did too. "

I have taken the Olly Probiotic women's formula for two weeks now and with the assistance of medicine and I am currently at proper ph.  My doctor has said that probiotics work differently for everyone and what works for one woman may not work for another. The cap is hard to snap open and the entire lid comes off when I try to get the pills out instead of being able to pop open the cap.  The snap-open cap is supposed to allow a person to take a pill from the lid instead of trying to get a pill out.  However, when I try to open this, the entire lid comes off.  This is not a child-proof container and would prefer that any supplement I take be child-proof. This is a very big container for only 25 pills.  It seems that there should be more pills in the container to allow women to take this longer.  If there are only a few in the container because they expire quickly after opening, there should be a shelf life warning. Update- The formula does not seem to be as helpful for my body as other brands I have used.  Perhaps, it takes a longer duration. Suggestions for improvement -Childproof cap -More pills per container -more on the making of your probiotics "

I don't usually experience bloating or digestive issues, but I do experience water retention and swelling during hormonal fluctuations.

About an hour after taking the pill, I started to feel stomach cramps, stomach upset, and I am currently still extremely bloated and uncomfortable. I realize correlation isn't causation, but I do think it's odd that I'm experiencing new digestive issues  right after taking the pill. Everyone's body works differently so this may work great for some, but unfortunately the side effects cancelled out the benefits for me. I may try to take the supplement again after I'm feeling better and see if I feel any differently and adjust my review accordingly. "

I think weight loss really helps with libido but if that isn’t an option or if it’s something you are working on these pills help. You do have to take two daily.

Too early to report how they work, however I wanted to just note the confusing packaging! Happy Hoo Ha had the outer safety plastic wrap as well as the seal under the lid. Lovin Libido had the outer wrap but nothing under the lid. I assumed it had been tampered with and threw it away. However I got a bottle of Lovin Libido from my local Target and it also had only the outer wrap! So I’m not really sure what to expect from this brand and safety wrapping, I don’t know if they have a standard. Otherwise easy to ingest. No interaction with Happy Hoo Ha. Only taking them for a week now so I am not sure about results yet. "

I decided to try these to see if they really would have any effect. The directions are to take 2 caps daily with water and then wait. They also say it may take up to two weeks to notice any difference. I decided to start with one cap the first night and see where that got me. About 45 minutes after I took the OLLY cap I felt anxious, jittery, uncomfortable and my stomach was very upset. I thought possibly I was getting sick. The feelings went away when I fell asleep, so I sort of just ignored them. The next night I took one more OLLY cap and when I started to experience all the same unpleasant symptoms all over I knew right away the OLLY vitamins were not for me.

I want to share with others considering buying this product that it is SO worth it! I see a lot of this advertised and try them out, usually resulting in disappointment, but not with Sex Dust. Personally, I am 20 years old and I have always had a low sex drive, if any at all. (I know I'm young but this stuff is magic for me) You know, after the honeymoon stage things sometimes... plateau, we'll say. But after taking Sex Dust, I experience a sexual energy maybe 12-24 hours after investing, I'm actually genuinely horny!!! (Side note- i double the dosage to 2 tsp instead of 1) And that's without the help from tequila, sexy music, mood lighting or candles. I notice that if I drink it with my coffee in the morning it hits me the most the following morning. My boyfriend is always telling me to take it because he says it makes me more adventurous hehe. My favorite part about moon juice is the half asleep/half awake orgasms I have, so intense! Ladies, if you're stuck in a plateau or finding it very hard getting turned, or have a low sex drive, this stuff is magic!! Would definitely recommend!!"

I normally have a high sex drive but about 7 days out of the month I experience pretty awful PMS and lose my sex drive completely, I feel gross as well as angry and stressed. It's really miserable. This stuff works so so well for helping me smooth the rough edges off my mood during this time and keep my sex drive. It did not make me feel incredibly extra aroused, however as I said my drive is already pretty good outside of hell week. But this is worth taking alone for improving my mood, libido and lowering my stress levels during that time of the month. I'm taking a star off for the OUTRAGEOUS price- $38 for a 15 day supply? If one jar was a one month supply I wouldn't quibble but having to buy 2 jars a month in order to take one dose a day is nuts. Either make your jars larger or lower the price. That said, if you can afford it DO give it a try. Despite being really annoyed at the price I will continue to purchase because I've tried everything (including having a medical MJ card) and this works better for my PMS!"

In a one week period, I have committed to a threesome, made sex eyes at my 50 year old client, and have had to stop working at home to avoid masturbating multiple times a day. I've actually stopped using it to see if it is in fact the dust or my new found singledom that's making me so insane.

I've worked in a health flood store, and studied Ayurveda in school- so I understand that it's not always about taste- and you'll actually find that most herbs are quite bitter- hense why they capsulate them!

Upon receiving my own because I was so pleased with the results, I race home to open them.. to be seemingly disappointed with how much actually came in the jar itself. :/ After taking out the packet that was in there (I'm assuming for keeping it fresh) there was even more of a hole!! For the price point it's especially disappointing. The pictures they have on the website show the powder filled to the very top and for the price, quite honestly that's what I was expecting. I still do love this company, and love their products results even more. Trying to give the benefit of the doubt but... all 3 of my jars came this way."

But, I started drinking it in hot water with unsweetened cocoa powder as my nightly ritual, and after about a week or so, if I'm also controlling my stress, when my husband gets a little frisky, I'm all for it without any effort on my part.

I have suffered from mild to moderate depression and PMDD (pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder) probably since I was a teen, but officially diagnosed at the age of 28. I am almost 45 now, and I have ALWAYS avoided medications (tried but just never liked what they did to me, including SSRI's). I've also tried lots of other supplements and adaptogens from other companies. But THIS combination is IT! This helps with mood and energy and a feeling of wellbeing and makes my cycle WAY more tolerable and less swingy (moods that is). Maybe not everyone will feel the dramatic change like me, as everyone is different (always consult with a doctor if you have really bad mood or physical symptoms before trying to self-help), but def worth the try! I use Sex Dust in the morning with almond milk or in my latte or even hot cocoa AND ALSO use Dream Dust in the evenings, religiously (totally helps you relax and unwind and I have been an insomniac for half a decade). I SWEAR by the combinations of the two and on days I don't take them, I am DEF off. They have worked SO well that I have JUST gotten a set (Sex and Dream Dust) for my newly married daughter, told her to take Sex Dust in the morning and Dream Dust in the evening, like me, and DAY ONE, she loves them! I don't usually write reviews but wanted to share... get this, and see what other Moon Juices work for you : ). And does it help in the BEDROOM? Hubby and I have been more active this and last month than in all of 2021 ; ) (enhanced mood, energy, and well-being) This combination is GOLD!"

My libido is slowly getting better, and I can tell because I’m easier to get turned on and more passionate. The most I have noticed was using in the morning with a cup of warm oat milk. I like to start my day by drinking me a cup, with a teaspoon of sex dust. I’ve noticed slightly different changes in my mood and libido.

I will pay 40$ for a month supply all day long, but 14 days? It’s a bit steep for me, and this is coming from someone who will pay 100$ for a bottle of perfume at Sephora no problem. For 40$, this should be a MONTH’s supply, not just two weeks. I do like how it makes me feel, and I can tell a slight difference in a week by drinking a cup and a teaspoon once daily for a week, but for 40$? Moon juice needs bigger jars and more portions for the price. Having a low libido sucks, but I have noticed I’m more sexual, and a women who is 31 with no kids, and has never really cared much for sex can appreciate that. I like the taste like I said.

It doesn’t full dissolve as it states, but I didn’t mind drinking it down & it did not actually change the taste of my coffee that I take in hazelnut. This stuff gave me great energy& my mood overall just set the day. I felt happy and upbeat. I’m a grumpy grump! I feel better overall. It is a very tiny amount for the price,but you don’t use a lot either. I would recommend this product definitely."

Idk why everyone freaks out about the taste. That was my favorite part. I’m on SSRI which killed my libido. I tried another supplement before this one with zero improvement. Was going to give this one another go and order a 2nd jar but my dr decided to switch my meds and told me to stop supplements until I see how they work. This time it’s not SSRI. Can’t help but wonder if the effects of sex dust would’ve been felt with continued use. That’s why I give this one 3 stars. Taste was great, no weird side effects, and the possibility of effects felt after continued use."

What I am commenting on is the texture and taste. It's like dumping cocoa powder into your water. And, about as pleasent. The taste is that of cocoa powder. The effect of being placed in water is less than appealing. It would be best in coffee or a smoothie. Or hot cocoa. But, as a drink before bed, do not use water. "

I know it wasn’t the coffee as I drink it daily. I didn’t necessarily feel sexy or in the mood, but it’s only day 1. (Maybe I spent all my energy cleaning lol) Day 2 I only did more than half the recommended amount to have less of the earthy taste and I can barely taste it - I will write if I feel a difference after a week of trying. Week update: I have a significant improvement with energy and I can see improvement in libido, I use a little more than half a teaspoon still up I barely notice the earthy taste anymore and get more of the cocoa! I will probably buy again Update: I have energy consistently when adding half a teaspoon to my coffee in the morning. Taste doesn’t bother me at all anymore - you get used to it, just like coffee.

I tried it in some warm unsweetened almond milk and didn't like it as much but I certainly did not think it tasted like dirt or badly in any way. I tried it my coffee but the coffee seemed a bit chalky and the powder would settle at the bottom some. I also mixed it into smoothies and then I couldn't even tell it was there. However, although I liked the taste of it, the jar is very small... I ordered it on April 6 and used 1 teaspoon of it every day until it was gone. I used the entire jar by the first week of May. So it barely lasted 1 month. I didn't feel any different at all while taking it. I didn't have more energy during the day and I didn't notice any change whatsoever in my sexual appetite. I wouldn't buy this again but it was worth a try. (I highly recommend Foria Wellness oils... those really work!) "

Because, really?  Do you throw this stuff in the air, sparkles rain down and you're transformed into the walking equivalent of sexual napalm? Actually, it's a bit deeper than that.  Literally and figuratively. First impression: the packaging is cute.  Plus, anything that has the word 'Moon' in it has my attention, only that's just personal opinion.  Upon reading the label, I was impressed with the ingredients, chiefly the use of Maca, Cacao, and Shilajit. To explain all of this here would make for a lengthy review, so in short, antioxidant powerhouses to do your body nothing but good.  Speaking of, the taste is pleasant.  I've picked up the cacao (chocolate) and a cinnamon character when I add it to herbal tea. Even though the directions recommend 1 teaspoon, I find that putting in 1/2 tsp. helps the product last longer; very rarely do I ""double"" the dose in one sitting. The most economic option would be to use once daily, although sometimes I'll add 1/2 tsp with morning tea and the same amount before bed.  (Note: Despite no nutrition label, this formula is low glycemic). My results: While I have been using the Beauty Dust for nearly two weeks, I have been alternating between that and the Sex Dust (you can use to two in conjunction of each other).  So far I haven't ""experienced' anything profound from consuming the Sex Dust since it has only been a week, but that's not to say I haven't noticed changes.  The first I see is the clarity of my face within the first 3 days of using the Beauty Dust. There is definitely a ""glow"" and overall my skin feels softer, not to mention a feeling of calm which washes over me after I finish my daily dose of either. Overall, I highly recommend trying this if you're looking for a health tonic to boost your overall physical well-being. Try it once and see what you think! "

If I see an improvement, then I continue and if not then I just don't buy it again.  I've been using this for nearly a month now in hopes it would maybe balance out my hormones a bit, boost my energy, and generally feel healthier.  I'm honestly not sure if it's really done much.  I've been getting acupuncture and taken TCM herbs for about a year for hormones, and I've noticed more of an improvement doing that rather than taking this every day (and one visit with my acupuncturist a month plus herbs only costs anywhere between the same price as this or $10-30 more than this stuff!).  Needless to say, I'm probably not going to buy another bottle.  I think it tastes better than the Beauty Dust, but taste alone is not a good enough reason to spend $60 on a bottle that will maybe last a month. "

My husband and I enjoy the ritual of drinking it together in the evenings. Has a pleasant, grassy taste. "

I tend to be skeptical of products like these and 2. I've made over 100 purchases on Amazon and this is the first of which I felt inclined to write a review. With a grueling work and travel schedule, I had nearly lost interest in this aspect of my life for almost a year and a half now. I tried taking maca every day for over a month and did not feel any different. The taste doesn't bother me, but then again my diet is healthy and I can get over the taste of something for the sake of its health benefits. I mix it with a bit of almond milk and nothing else really--it has too many flavor notes as it is to add much more. I assumed this was the kind of thing I had to take daily over time and let it build in my system--no. I have taken the recommended dose of this product three times now over two weeks and felt the effects within several hours each time. I had increased physical sensitivity and warm fuzzy feelings a few hours after the very first dose. Fairly subtle, but no debate as to whether there was a change. The most recent time is what inspired me to write this review. I tried a double dose and then later took a nap. I had not one, but three, extremely vivid dreams (you can guess which kind), and woke up extremely desirous. NOT subtle--like a light switch. I just can't believe how well this works! My hubby and I are extremely happy to have found a solution. "

It's only been about day 3 for me so I feel like not much can happen in that time frame. I'm going to stick with it though and see if it makes any changes to my lifestyle. "

The taste is pretty good, like raw cacao and blends easily into smoothies; not so much in hot beverages- it settles to the bottom. I'll be interested to see results in the next few weeks, I have my husband using it too! "

I was attracted to Moon Juice because as a more holistic family, we try hard to use and consume products as natural as we are able to find.  This seemed just the product to help enhance the ""fun."" While it is natural and tastes much like a subtle chocolatey drink, it is not so subtle once in your system.  I must admit that I was surprised at the heightened awareness and sensitivity this product provided and beyond that, you will have to try it for yourself.  Some things are better left unsaid! Will I purchase it again?  Most certainly.  My husband especially likes to leave the jar lying around as a hint ;) "

I actually notice a huge difference in my hormones and stress levels when I take it regularly.  I also really like the flavor, which is more pronounced than the other dusts I have tried but has a nice, chocolate-y, warming taste to it. "

It definitely works for it's intended purpose, but for me it has a few more benefits as well. First off, the product was shipped promptly with great packaging. Secondly, the labelling is very cute. I love the design of it. Once it arrived, I tried it with a protein powder that I mixed in a blender. Simply put, I was very happy with how I felt afterwards. I initially thought that it would be good in smoothies, but, as others have noted it is good as a tea as well. I just microwave a cup of water and mix in a teaspoon of powder. A little gritty, as there are some solids that do not seem to dissolve, but the flavor is nice. I get a real sense of well-being from this. Either it is fixing something, or providing a nutrient that I am lacking. I am now looking at other products in the line, if this is good, others will be too. "

We were so excited to try it. But the taste was a little less than what we hoped for. I did manage to get some down but I was so turned off by the taste it kind of blew my karma. I am going to try it again tho.  It did enhance or elevate our mood!!!

I have tried different products but Moon Juice sex dust gives an almost instant effect. Give or take 5 minutes and it begins to take effect and puts me in the mood. The taste is earthy and easy to swallow, I mix mine in juice or plain water- gives the same effect. I give it 4 stars because of the price and wish it was less expensive. I have been using other Moon Juice products for about a year now and will continue to do so. Still wish they were less expensive. "
