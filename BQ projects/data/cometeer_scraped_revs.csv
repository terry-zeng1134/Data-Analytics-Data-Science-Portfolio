4,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Light Box,01/20/2022,I loved it enough that I'm strongly considering downsizing my niche/rocket espresso setup and just driving Cometeer.,5

6,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Dark Box,01/18/2022,"Though my home office (literally a garage) is a bland, unassuming space, when I have a cup of Cometeer's exquisite coffee it seems like a barista-crafted palace. There's nothing I cannot achieve when Cometeer-delivered caffeine courses through my otherwise-weary veins.* The convenience, the flavor, the style! A miracle of science. 

*Please do not consume Cometeer intravenously. To do anything but drink it would be blasphemy.",5

8,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Decaf Box,01/18/2022,"I don't get to drink a lot of coffee, because I only drink decaf and my husband makes a pot of regular every day.  I hated the thought of keurig, with all the little plastic pods, and Cometeer has solved all of this for me.  Now when I want coffee I can just pull a pod out of the freezer and then recycle the pod.  The taste of the coffee was fantastic, and didn't even need sugar. That's the sign of a good cup of coffee for me!",5
9,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Medium/Dark Box,01/18/2022,Taste is exceptional but the cost is prohibitive.,5
10,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Light Box,01/18/2022,Really easy to make and tastes great!,5
11,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Medium Box,01/17/2022,"This is utterly different. A number of years ago I started studying coffee; going to tastings, going to cuppings, and learning to actually experience the tasting notes, etc. The downside of this is that I find a good 90% of all coffee - specifically talking about coffee made in Third Wave shops - undrinkable. And whole beans are only drinkable for two weeks after which I can immediately tell the volatiles are gone and it's stale. And since there isn't a good roaster near me it's just too costly to get a bag shipped one at a time and two bags will stale before using.

But so far, these pods - all the Medium Roast - have been ... WOW! All four are absolutely DELICIOUS. Mouth-licking delicious. There is a particular ... note .. a taste maybe a sort of chocolate or leather that they ALL have. I, personally, associate this iwth George Howell's Roasting style. I have had his roasts at his roaster and even the pucks made by Klatch and Joe for example have that particular depth to them. 

I am REALLY excited about this. If you too find that a drinkable cup seems out of your grasp at home - and frankly even in shops - give these a try and see what you think.",5
12,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Light/Medium Box,01/17/2022,"I’ve always preferred dark roasts because I love the flavor punch and find it hard to take weak-tasting coffee.  But Cometeer coffees are so well prepared that I can taste the delicate complexity in the light and medium roasts and still enjoy a well-rounded, complete flavor. No need for cream in my coffee now.",5

19,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Light Box,01/17/2022,"I am admittedly a “coffee snob”. I bring my aeropress with me on business trips and go to the ends of the earth to find the freshest beans. I received my first box of Cometeer from a very thoughtful friend who knows I have a newborn and do not have the time to go out searching for beans. I thought I’d use Cometeer as a supplement for when I’m unable to find good coffee. Instead, I’m finding myself preferring Cometeer over my pour over! To say I’m in love is an understatement.",5

29,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Mixed Box,01/16/2022,I'm really glad I tried Cometeer. The coffee arrived quickly and I've had an opportunity to give each a good test.

37,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Dark Box,01/15/2022,"Great customer service. Quickly sent a new shipment when a snafu caused mine to melt during a delay.

50,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Dark Box,01/12/2022,"This is what I would compare Cometeer to... Imagine the most expensive bottle of wine that has been perfectly aging for 20 years. It is ready to open, to enjoy, to live in its glory. And the moment it is ready, you flash freeze it, so you can savor it over and over again. This is what Cometeer is to me, the perfect cup of coffee that is at the peak of its delicious taste. It is so convenient and easy to make in the mornings. A true treat. Not only is it easy to make, but it is so versatile. Espresso Martini? Done! Iced Coffee? DONE! TIRAMISU?!?! DONE. We have done it all and will continue to explore the options. Have already gifted to multiple people and will continue to do so!",5

I found the Cometeer great tasting and smooth. I needed 2 capsules in 14 oz to compare with my normal 28 gram dose. Perfect when   I don't want to take the time for grinding and making coffee. One note, after heating the capsule with hot water, shake to confirm the puck is loose before opening the lid.",5

55,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Light Box,01/12/2022,"As someone that seeks coffee that’s as fresh as 2 to 5 days, having fresh bags shipped home is an impossibility, although I still try. Going to the local coffee roaster for a fresh bag only results in coffee getting stale after a few days.

I love this product for that. Although, with Cometeer, I can no longer have as much coffee as I used to. I suspect the caffeine is much higher because I sense it more.",5

60,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Mixed Box,01/11/2022,The coffee is great.  It tastes like freshly brewed coffee is supposed to taste.  I enjoyed the aroma as the hot water was hitting the cube.  What I missed was the actual making of the coffee.  The smell of freshly ground coffee.  And the aroma as it steeps. It was almost as if it was too easy.  I will cycle in this coffee along with my moka pot and french press.  By the way I enjoy the dark roast and medium roasts a great deal!,5
61,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Light Box,01/11/2022,This is the best coffee I have had in a long time.,5
62,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Decaf Box,01/11/2022,The coffee is amazing.  I feared that it would taste like instant coffee and it does not! The only problem I have is getting the lid off the pod especially when it is wet.  Lol.  😆,5

67,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Light Box,01/11/2022,"It really does taste like an expertly brewed fresh cup of coffee. This is a great way to try several different coffees at once.

70,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Light Box,01/11/2022,"My usual morning coffee is a light roast Kenyan or Ethiopian from an excellent local roaster, ground at home moments before brewing on my carefully curated coffee setup. Scales, precise temperature control, timers, the whole deal. Some mornings I don't have time to go through that whole process, but skipping coffee isn't an option. On those days, Cometeer comes to the rescue. All four coffees I received were interesting, lively, and not at all inferior to the best cups of coffee I've made at home. I'm very impressed!",5

74,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Medium/Dark Box,01/11/2022,"Let’s first start off with saying I am not a morning person. I value my sleep. I try to spend as long as a humanely can sleeping. Unfortunately, this makes my mornings fairly chaotic trying to squeeze in all the things in fairly unforgiving and short timeline - including drinking great coffee. I am ashamed to admit, but I used to sacrifice good tasting coffee in lieu of convenience and more sleep. I am saying I would choose to drink Folgers or maxwell house if it meant I could get a few more extra minutes of sleep. But in comes cometeer. Fantastic coffee at a fantastic speed. I love it. It has revolutionized my mornings. I am converted. Sign me up for any and all cometeer evangelism courses.",5

I wasn't expecting anything life-changing, but was so surprised and amazed by the quality of this coffee. After trying almost every home-brewing method there is, I can confidently say I've never had coffee that is so consistently good as Cometeer. Such a major bonus to have something that is so easy to make -- I look forward to drinking my coffee the next morning as I'm falling asleep!",5

    The levels of flavor that can be tasted are fantastic and complex. 
    Never have I tasted better coffee. 

Best used as ice coffee in my opinion. 
   So many different varieties are available from cometeer. 

     If you enjoy hot coffee there are plenty of more affordable alternatives.

But it’s 80-90% of the way there and for a daily cup of coffee, it’s good enough. $2/cup for very good single origin is excellent value considering time and shipping costs per bag.

220,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Light Box,12/14/2021,"This stuff is no joke. Thought it would be just like any other 3rd wave instant coffee. Overpriced, gimmicky, and not worth it. But cometeer legit changed my coffee habits. I keep them at work. I keep them at home. I made my family buy them just to make sure I always have access to these little pucks of frozen wonder. Some of the best cups of coffee I’ve had. And you’d never know it was from a little frozen cylinder. It’s worth every penny.",5
221,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Mixed Box,12/13/2021,This coffee is amazing!   I am normally a light roast person but trying the mixed box I actually enjoyed the dark roast coffees. It's definitely worth trying if you aren't really sure what you like.,5
222,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Medium/Dark Box,12/13/2021,It was a gift for my wife and she loves it.  We are looking forward to future shipments.,5

231,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Mixed Box,12/12/2021,"Really love the flavor of your pods. Price point is a little high but something I could work with for personal use. 

My question is: Is this available commercially? I have a restaurant that I'd like to introduce your coffee through but the price is too high for me to offer to our guests. I'd have to cancel free refills and charge more. Maybe I can offer it in addition to what I have now but I'm not sure how to go about contacting you for a discussion. Is this something you're offering?

Thanks in advance for any help you can provide!",5

235,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Dark Box,12/09/2021,"Honestly, I came in as a skeptic and now I am a sold believer. First, the coffee arrived quickly and was still very cold when delivered. Secondly, I usually do not drink dark coffee, but every single flavor is just amazing. My favorite is the Homeschool blend or Equator blend. The convenient part is that the pod capsule are compatible with a Keurig, however, I also have an electric kettle so heating water doesn't take long at all either method. I definitely plan to buy more in the future!",5

I love plain black coffee, but I'm also a sucker for iced lattes! It's so nice and easy to pour the melted coffee in a cup of milk and ice. I love having it in the freezer for when I want a quick cup of jo to go! All the coffee that I've had so far tastes great! In fact, I'd probably prefer it over the coffee from most of the nearby coffee shops... but that's also because I don't have any good local shops near me lol! 

At the end of the day, I can see myself continuing to get Cometeer! I probably won't get it every month, but every once in a while, I'd like to place an order. :)",5

461,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Mixed Box,11/03/2021,The best packaged coffee I’ve ever had. Right on par with premium coffee shop brews. Love the ability to recycle the packaging as opposed to Keurig or Nespresso pods. The one negative: I wish I had more control over the shipping. I was out of town when my shipment arrived and it sat in my lobby for two days before I could move it to my freezer. The quality was still fantastic but I was nervous. Some absolute to schedule the shipment would be great.,5

Buying the equipment, learning the methods, making fine tune adjustments. Cometeer fixes this by bringing you all of the effort and care that goes into the cup that I make, but in the world's simplest and easiest to make and use pod, and it's straight up delicious. Well done gang. Will be buying more.",5
465,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Mixed Box,11/02/2021,I was pleasantly surprised with the depth of flavor from the coffees! They were all delicious in their own ways and I’m loving using them for both hot and cold drinks. My order came several days later and I was worried they would be melted. This was definitely the fault of FedEx but luckily they finally arrived and we’re just barely still frozen. Looking forward to my next shipment!,5

So when I saw an advertisement for Cometeer I thought ""Ok ... maybe"" but I had my doubts. I mean, how can a frozen coffee concentrate be as good as something I make fresh? Well - these packs were obviously put together by fellow coffee snobs. If I am taking a quality hit for the convenience, it isn't noticeable by me.

476,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Mixed Box,11/01/2021,"The mixed box allowed me a broad comparison of Cometeer’s products. I was duly impressed from my first cup. I found the coffee to be consistently flavorful and as if just brewed. The light was clean with clear, distinct flavor. The medium were both well balanced and flavorful with variations that would only emerge from fresh brewing. The dark was full-bodied and still delicate and smooth in the finish. I had hoped to be impressed by the promise your marketing suggested and was  surprised to find it lived up to expectations and then some. I have been turned off other frozen/perishable items due to unsustainable packaging and was very happy to find yours was completely recyclable. Essential! Delicious alternative to office coffee, and well appreciated when camping or for a quick to go from home. I love what you’re doing and how. Hire me!",5

But the goal, of course, is to drink the cup and taste something that's not too bitter or sour but just right. Cometeer is an easy way to skip all the beginning stuff and arrive at a great cup of coffee. The cometeer coffee is very good water down and taken black (if anything a bit under-extracted for my taste, though that could be user error). Cometeer coffee excels in latte-form, especially if you have a milk frother. I'm not going to give up brewing my own coffee, but I will make sure I always have some cometeer in the freezer for the days when I don't have time for the whole process.",5

Mostly because it was f****** delicious. But also, because I would often go to that same coffee shop, which is now ninety minutes from my home in the the peaks of California's hygge inducing mountains. I'm on the second flavor and it's just as wonderful. Deliciousness and nostalgia all in one incredibly special aluminum cup.. Thank you for making my experience in this life that much better.

I drank them in their iced ""latte"" forms with oat milk and my fiance tried them all with the standard hot coffee preparation. It serves as a wonderful ""in-between bags of beans"" brew or whenever we're a bit too busy to grind and prepare a more traditional cup. Definitely worth a try to experience the different flavors and to keep a pack or two in the freezer for a lightening quick cup of good coffee with no fuss that anyone can prepare. The initial purchase price does give me pause, but at around $2 a cup, it's more getting over the sticker shock than anything. To be transparent, I bought the Pilot Program box at $32 for 32 pods (a very reasonable and attractive price point) while I believe the real price is $64 for 32 pods. We've gone through about 8 pods over the course of a week and with 4 boxes, a single purchase can easily last a month and a half. Which is about a couple bags of beans anyway. I do greatly appreciate how the packaging is fully recyclable and doesn't include any plastic other than the bag that holds the dry ice (which is always a fun bit to safely play with). Overall, if you're reading this, I'd recommend you at least try it.

Making the coffee is super easy and it's delicious. I can actually drink it black now...something I've never been able to do with other brands. It's not what I would call ""cheap"" coffee, but it's definitely cheaper and better than any coffee shop I've ever had.",5
546,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Medium/Dark Box,10/25/2021,Cometeer coffee is like no other.  You can taste the freshness.,5
547,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Mixed Box,10/25/2021,"I am an iced coffee goer all the way, with a handful of hot cups throughout the year. I've been cold brewing with rudimentary methods and have felt like a caveman. Cometeer made me feel like an astronaut, pun totally intended. 

Every flavor tastes great, and having options is the best way to not get sick of the same dang beverage every morning. The individual cup portions make it a fresh brew every single time.

One unexpected plus is the extra counter space you'll get if you use a instant coffee maker or traditional coffee pot. All that goes away if you like it iced.

This has zero to do with coffee quality, but they pump that their little cups are 100% recyclable. When you receive your coffee, you'll realize that's maybe 3% of their actual packaging. The rest of it not so green (large box, insulation, dry ice in heavy duty plastic bags, pretty high quality printed marketing stuff). The brown stuff is good enough without the failed attempt to go green.",5
548,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Mixed Box,10/25/2021,I am glad I chose the mixed box option as I got to try out all the variants Cometeer has to offer. I loved every one of those variants.,5
549,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Mixed Box,10/25/2021,"For a long, time, I’ve been seeking an efficient way to drink flavorful coffee without spending huge sums on money on fancy machines or local coffee houses.  Found Cometeer and it’s the solution.  Delicious coffee that takes the same amount of time to make as instant but is more delicious than the  fanciest brewhouse at a fraction of the cost.",5
550,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Mixed Box,10/25/2021,"Amazing. Sure you have your pour over and kettle. You wait 30 seconds for the bloom at the right temperature. You add another five minutes to make your cup of coffee, and it's the best thing in the world. Except you just wasted 10 minutes of your day, for that rich smooth subtle flavor you've come to expect from a tedious pour. Cometeer brings all the flavor without the hassle. And these freeze dried pods deliver in a matter of minutes, rather than the laborious effort it takes to make your pour over. All of it is heavenly.",5
551,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Medium/Dark Box,10/25/2021,"Great taste, easy to prepare, and it's recyclable. All good things.",5
552,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Light Box,10/25/2021,"I was very pleased with the coffee I received from Cometeer.  My initial order was a variety pack, and while I liked some of the varieties more than others, none of them disappointed.  I appreciated having the ability to choose from different flavor profiles, and it was a fun mystery to try a pod from a new pack for the first time.  I will definitely be ordering again when I run out, which might be soon.

I don't consider myself a coffee snob, but I am particular about what I like, and frankly
I have not met a convenience coffee I have liked.  That said, I have not tried or even seen any coffee product presented as frozen pods before, so Cometeer caught my attention very quickly, and I was more willing to give the product a chance.  Because it is packaged and presented in a way that is so innovative and unique, it is almost unfair to compare it to other instant coffees, or even pod based coffees, but since that really is the closest comparable competition, I feel confident saying that Cometeer is much better than any I have had.

Flavor wise, I would say that everything I tried exceeded any traditional drip coffee I've had, and is most comparable to something that came out of a french press.  Cometeer still has the advantage in that making a cup of coffee by adding hot water to their pod in a mug is more convenient and doesn't leave a mess to clean up.  I look forward to trying more of Cometeer's products in the future with my wife, and plan on placing orders for family members on the Nice list this Christmas.",5
553,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Mixed Box,10/25/2021,Very convenient and really good flavor relatively speaking. Best solution for at home coffee!,5

I said why not try it out, can honestly say I’m so happy I did. I get up at 4:30 for work so it is perfect to just make a quick and absolutely tasty iced latte.

Even with defrosted for how long pods I decided to throw them all back into the freezer, what's the worst thing that could happen. (Please don't tell me know there's some kind of growth thing that can make me ill). The first cup of coffee -which I now jump over to your website to find the name of, which I can't find because the pic with names are the medium roasts and couldn't find a text list either, so I can't tell you which one it is... was stunningly lovely, like coffee I've never had before. Like, drink it down like the need for water with it's beautiful taste, for a refreshing, clean and flavorful experience. Did I say not bitter or acidic, yeah. I grind my own beans for goodness sake, and Cometeer coffee right out of the pod struck a cord with perfect coffee simply made for those maddening days of ""I got to get going.""

924,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Light Box,08/02/2021,The coffee was amazing. I have tried almost all of them and cannot wait to continue drinking!,5
925,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Mixed Box,08/01/2021,"I like this coffee subscription the best! It’s so convenient that i don’t think I can go back to the old ways of making coffee. Plus, the coffee is so fresh and full of flavor and complexity that I was not able to achieve with my amateur technique. Leave it to the pros!",5
926,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Mixed Box,07/30/2021,"Someone showed me these over summer vacation. I laughed and eye-rolled ""ah just what we need, another Keurig thing"". I tried it partly to be polite.

Where I live, we are serious about coffee. We roast our own beans*. We own two(!) digital burr grinders and digital water heaters. Scales, timers, espresso, Aeropress with four different filters. If we did want to buy retail beans we have about 100 totally respectable options within walking distance of our house. Being impervious to caffeine, we have a cup an hour before bedtime, just because we can. Etc etc

Anyway back to summer: the first few sips of Cometeer I almost didn't know what I was drinking. Is this coffee? Where is the bitterness? It started to cool. Holy ****. My host was smiling, watching me expectantly. ""there are some other flavors if you want to try, just help yourself"" 

Haha I feel bad; I pretty much cleaned dude out of his supply over a week or two. He pointed me towards the waiting list/subscription thing. There was another eye-roller: there's no way I'm gonna drink 32 of these every month. 

Got my first box of 32 cups - the **** was gone in eight days. lol I did give a few away. 

Don't know what to say really. Am I lazy, or a bad person or something, that I just want to switch to Cometeer full-time? It's simply amazing stuff. Coaxing every last nuance and subtlety of flavor out of the bean with zero bitterness. It makes most other coffee taste like someone lit an old, sweaty cowboy boot on fire. 

Anyway thanks! You have my love and devotion. Favorites so far have been Montecarlos, San Carlos, Santa Ines. East 14th is everyday morning stuff; Coltrane for afternoon/evening/after-meal.

I'm sure you guys have scoured the planet for the best roasters and have a solid roster by now - but one suggestion for you is Black Oak roasters in Ukiah, California, one of the best in the state IMO - their specialty is probably ""light"" roasts with the floral and bright fruit thing going on. Ukiah is a gateway to the marijuana country of the North (so it could be a fun trip for your rep, depending).

TLDR: six/five stars omg

Take care! Looking forward,
Charlie

1237,cometeer.com,Jot,Discovery Kit,05/13/2021,"I love the convenience of using the Cometeer capsules. They’re easy to use. You can thaw a few capsules in the refrigerator ahead of time, or you can thaw them quickly in some hot water. The box packaging fits easily in my freezer (and my freezer is usually already crowded). I love that the capsules are easy to recycle (just rinse it well before recycling). I’ve tried instant coffees and other coffee capsules, but Cometeer gives me the closest result to my beloved lattes from cafes. I just use ice, Half & Half, and a melted Cometeer capsule, and I’m enjoying an Iced Breve Latte within a few minutes. I don’t even need to add sugar. Instant Coffees are usually too bitter for me, requiring sweetening. I barely finish my instant coffee iced drinks, because they’re not creamy enough for me, even if made with Half & Half (and they lack a smooth coffee flavor). If you serve Cometeer to your friends, they’ll think you trained as a barista. I highly recommend Cometeer to all coffee lovers.",5

It’s not that difficult to thaw them out in the refrigerator the day before, or to thaw them in some hot water if you need to use them quicker. The box packaging for the capsules are small enough to fit in the freezer easily. It’s nice that the capsules are recyclable. I just rinse them and toss them in the recycling bin. No need to worry about what’s recyclable or compostable. I like my coffee iced. When I use the Cometeer melted coffee mixed in with Half & Half and ice, it’s the closest to the Iced Breve Lattes I get at cafes. I don’t even need to add sugar, like I have to do with instant coffees.",5

1253,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Mixed Box,05/06/2021,"Overall experience has been awesome. Super impressed with the taste and convenience.

I sent the following to Ashley in Customer Support:

Packaging: Everything was very straight forward about what could be recycled except for the padded pieces with the packaging peanuts. The paper looks waxy so I'm not sure that I can recycle that? I know the packaging peanuts are usually compostable - more information on this would be super helpful. As a consumer I'm getting very particular about how stuff is packed or packaged and trying to minimize waste as much as possible. The plastic bag with the sticker - I get it - everyone loves stickers - but then I'm stuck with a plastic bag. Not sure I have a solution other than not including this or finding another form of packaging.

Brewing: Again, pretty straightforward for the suggested recipes but I'm wondering if there could be better messaging about water temperature? I am used to heating water to a specific temperature for pour overs. So I started by just heating up water that way and then adding the capsule. I did notice the preferred temp of drinking coffee at around 130 degrees. If I used the microwave to heat the water for about 1:30 minutes I could get it to about 160ish and then after adding the capsule it brought it down to that suggested range. Where am I going with this - maybe more instruction on how to get to that temperature range because if I end up with a cup that's too cold then I'm microwaving my coffee which IMO just destroys the taste.",5

Sometimes it feels like more attention is paid to light roast in the third wave coffee world, and as a medium/dark roast drinker it’s easy to have a bit of fomo, so imagine my surprise to see a single origin dark roast in my box!! That being said, a couple of things would be icing on the cake: being able to customize boxes (i.e light and dark box), a friend referral program (we have tons of coffee drinking friends!), and a small price reduction to $1.5/pod. My husband drinks light roast and is buying his beans so that on top of my cometeer subscription is a bit much. Overall totally worth it though!

Awesome concept and great packaging and presentation. But of course, flavor is all that matters. And in this regard, Cometeer is exceptional. Only suggestion is to make an XL pod, because 6-8 oz per cup is a bit small when it tastes this good. I could always double up, but that’s a lot of caffeine.

Now, for me, it's a traveling solution, I wouldn't drink that every day, mostly because I like the ritual of making my coffee, but on the go, it was *perfect* to get good coffee without having to bring a lot of gears.

Talking about gear, one thing I'd like is if with the capsule, you'd have some kind of tiny legs that you could ""deploy"" to suspend it on top of your mug somehow, so when you pour the water, the pugs drop in the mug and it starts to dissolve instantly.
The way I did it, was holding the capsule in my hand, trying to not burn myself, and when it was in the mug, discard the capsule and pour the rest of the water.

Other than that, it's really a great product that I will be buying again, but not on a subscription basis, more like I'd buy a few boxes, keep them in the freezer for when I travel.",5

some small gripes
 - I wish the quantity per capsule was a bit lesser. Today, my wife and i split the coffee in the capsule (60-40) because we prefer different strengths in our coffee (and this brew at 60% of capsule is pretty strong for us

Ordering process is easy. Product and packaging are spot on. Cometeer customer service has been great throughout the pilot.

As for the coffee, we love the concept. The flavor quality is much better than the Starbucks - Keurig pods we use when we want to keep it simple. On par with the quality of the premium whole bean coffee we buy from local roasters, but much easier to make a couple cups a day with less wasted coffee.

In terms of use, we thaw the pods in a coffee cup with warm water for a few minutes before brewing to get the finished temp hot enough out of the Keurig. Other than that minor step, super efficient to use.

One area to look into is the Fed Ex shipping. Our first 2 shipments arrived 2-3 days later than what was indicated on the initial tracking info for the shipments. Not a big deal, but thought I’d share the feedback in case the delay is happening during the handoff to Fed Ex. Probably better to send the shipping notification after it has actually been handed off than when the label is generated.",5

I did have one packet where the seal broke while it was thawing in a cup of warm water and it wound up spilling out into the water. However, overall all of the coffee tasted great and the packaging held up nicely. 

I would say that it is a little pricey for a daily coffee, so I would like purchase every other month rather than keep a monthly subscription. 

You guys did a great job.

coffee was surprisingly good! tastes a lot better than you'd think ""an ice cube but it's coffee"" would taste! pretty fresh. i almost certainly couldn't tell the difference between this and ""real"" coffee if we did a blind cupping taste test.

george howell duronima is my favorite so far. tea notes were spot on. haven't tried the dark roast yet because i'm not a big fan of dark roasts but i'll get around to it.

i found it curious that the light roasts were still relatively balanced and moderate. i love super bright acidic african coffees and am looking forward to seeing how fresh and idiot-proof a cometeer fruit bomb can be.

price/value seems to be right where it needs to be for me. 100% better cup than a dripper or coffee crystals. more reliable and idiotproof than my aeropress or a pourover. cheaper (and easier) than going to the cafe before work.",5

Random but worth noting imo - I think you should move away from the ""drop the puck in water and enjoy"" imagery and instead be explicit about puck first, hot water second. Myself and two others learned this the hard way the first time - doing so splashes hot water out of the mug. 

Not a big deal to us but Im certain someone else will sue you (a la 1994 Liebeck v McDonald's) as you grow and get more popular.

This was, by far, the best damn cup of coffee I've had. (The El Injerto Red Cat) You have made an amazing product that gave me light and joy in these dark COVID-19 days.

1. I've referred this to now 5 of my coffee-addicted buddies who all signed up for the pilot program. Happy to do more, if you have a referral link, etc. would love to keep track of this. 

2. What's your next bottleneck as a startup? This is too great of a product to remain in limited supply and I'd love to help. :)

Lovely, flavorful coffees that are worth drinking just with hot water (big fan of being able to take a capsule, pop it in a Keurig and then immediately toss it into the recycling with no fuss). I do think there could be fewer fruity options in the mixed box though, especially since there are two medium roasts. Could just be that the coffees are too good at tasting like, well, great coffee.",4

I'm not too jazzed that you can only try it by actually starting a subscription. That approach feels...a little underhanded, frankly. You should consider offering a one-time ordering option or at least a one-time trial.",4

1854,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Mixed Box,01/10/2022,"I’m still figuring out which capsules are my favorite but all pretty good and really easy.  

I have an espresso machine and had gotten a bit bored with it. These capsules are great for switching things up. I use the hot water from machine so it easy to soak capsules and make coffee in a minute.",4
1855,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Mixed Box,01/09/2022,"My husband rolled his eyes when I explained my new subscription - another wasteful coffee item, like all the others.  I type that as he is making himself a Cometeer cup of coffee as he has every single day.  He is completely sold.  The convenience, quality, and ease of not fussing with a pot of coffee, and not spending $12 for Starbucks in the morning can’t be beat.  I never got into the K-cup craze because everything had a weird taste - almost plastic-like.  Now we are both sold on this way of making coffee, and I love that it’s a perfect serving size.  My only reason for giving it 4 stars is the inability to select or purchase coffees that you’ve enjoyed.  I would like trying new ones, but also having coffee that I tried and really liked would be ideal versus new coffee every time.",4
1856,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Light/Medium Box,01/07/2022,"On the whole, the quality of the coffee is quite good. Because it is so concentrated, it can sort of be used in the same applications as espresso. I have not been able to afford the expensive espresso grinder I want, and I would mostly be making black Americanos anyway, so when I saw James Hoffman felt Cometeer was high enough quality to get involved with, I decided to try it out.

There are two big benefits: how quick it is to use the pods, and how nice they taste. Since it is coffee and not espresso they don’t have quite as much complexity of flavor as I’d prefer, but it is VERY clean and balanced and enjoyable — exactly why I have pined for an expensive grinder. It has been a good stopgap and I will continue with it. 

It’s really easy to dissolve these in hot water, or lukewarm water and add ice. I have also put an undiluted pod over ice cream for an affogato, and while it’s not as good as an espresso affogato, it is still quite good.

I also like the varied selection, the price is reasonable relative to going to a coffee shop, and the pods are recycleable.

My only complaint is that the pods are not quite strong enough when diluted, and the light roasts especially cannot hold up to milk or sweetener. I’m not comparing them to espresso in this regard, just filter coffee. I find I can only dilute these in 6oz of water max, which is at least the low end of volume for a “cup of coffee,” but 4oz would be better and that’s barely any coffee. I understand the coffee is probably as concentrated as it can reasonably be, so I think it would be nice if the pods simply contained 30% more of the concentrated coffee.

Overall it’s a really cool, high quality product. I think it could be neat to freeze large doubleshots of espresso if feasible, though. I would switch to that in a heartbeat, but I will continue to use Cometeer until I have the grinder I want. And honestly I may still get Cometeer at a reduced frequency after that, since it’s still really convenient to just throw the little coffee ice cube into some lukewarm water rather than go through a whole song and dance every time. Pretty impressive product and I recommend it.",4
1857,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Light/Medium Box,01/07/2022,"Very reasonable product. The quality of the coffee is quite good, you can tell that Cometeer puts pride in their work. The price-per-cup ratio puts Cometeer considerably lower than most cups of coffee with a similar convenience in prep time. The all aluminium cups also reduce their environmental impact due to ease of recycling, which is rad. Only real downside is the annoying requirement to start and cancel a subscription every time I want to buy the product. I'd personally be willing to pay a bit more money for a non-subscription package, others probably would as well.",4
1858,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Medium/Dark Box,01/06/2022,"Will definitely be ordering again, just looking to try different varieties in the future. Mainly light roasts should they be available.",4
1859,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Light Box,01/06/2022,"I overall liked the frozen coffee experience. It still has some hints of instant coffee aroma and taste but not a deal breaker. Also, I wish the pods could be a little cheaper so I could order more.",4
1860,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Light/Medium Box,01/04/2022,"Price was good with the introduction discount, coffee taste close to freshly brew from pot. The only issue i see is, all 4 types of coffee taste pretty similar. There is no distinct difference between them, and i would prefer another light brew instead of 3 med 1 light. Not sure if i will continue if i have to pay the full price. Overall tho, nice and very convenient coffee with decent quality. Definitely taste much better than any ""k-cup"" coffee or instant coffee.",4
1861,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Mixed Box,01/04/2022,"Some of the best coffee I've had. Although, I would like to see what other medium roast options are available, as I didn't much care for either the blend or the available single-origin and normally medium roasts are my jam.",4
1862,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Dark Box,01/04/2022,"I was enticed to try this service because my access to high-quality coffee supplies was somewhat limited.  It was my hope that Cometeer's resources could cover up my shortcomings in that department.

Having had some time to drink this product alongside my own fresh-ground coffee from a boutique supplier, I am pleasantly surprised with both the quality and convenience it provides.  My only real complaint is the lack of choice with the subscription-box model; even if it is of high quality, my box included a brew that I just did not care for.  The inability to customize my coffee mix really hurts the experience and can guarantee at least a portion of my purchase goes to waste through no fault of my own.",4

I've cut back to drinking 1 cup/day and my husband doesn't drink coffee anymore, so this has been so convenient before work, especially as someone who is not a morning person. I was ok paying the intro price but the full price was too much, so I won't be a regular subscriber - can't justify the cost.",4
1867,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Mixed Box,01/04/2022,"The light, medium, and especially dark varieties are smooth and superior overall to other pods.   I was a bit disappointed in the Brazilian; it did not have the natural sweetness of other Brazilians.",4
1868,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Light Box,01/03/2022,"It’s the closest thing to an instant experience of pour over coffee I’ve seen. The coffee is much better than any k-cups or of that sort.

The way I used them was to heat the pods enough so the coffee block was just loose enough to fall out into the cup, and pour hot water (7 ounces) onto it.

What is different from a normal pour over is a slight astringency in the taste compared to my normal pour overs. But it’s slight enough that I’m fine with it. 
Although one other difference I have noticed is that I’ve felt a higher caffeine kick from this than my normal coffee. I’m not sure if it’s. A placebo, but it is an experience I’ve had.

All in all, brilliant for a lazy day fallback",4

The ease and simplicity of the 'pods' is fantastic. Being able to make a single cup vs. a pot of coffee eliminates the need to reheat or fear wasting it if I'm unable to drink it all (even if I had fully intended to drink all that I'd brewed). I also love that while they come in a 'pod', there's no need for a pod style brewing machine. And while it's recommended to use boiling water, I've had no issue heating water in a mug in the microwave for 2-3min and plopping the contents in after. While my husband and I appreciate that there's a nice variety of flavor notes and acidic sharpness in the medium/dark box we ordered, it's made it much easier to pick what we might want to try next.",4

My main concern is with the delivery method. I live pretty far out of town, and by the time my first shipment got to my house, the dry ice was gone and the coffee pods were partially melted. 

I put them in my freezer immediately and they were fine. I told Cometeer's customer service department about the issue and they sent me a whole month's supply for free. This shipment arrived fully frozen. Now that's a good company.

On of my friends was raving about it and I am a BIG coffee drinker and thought to try it since I was becoming bored with my french press and Kahlua blend. The only thing I did not like was some of the flavors of the blend was not tasty to me. For example the dark roast Chiapas and Crazy Goat Blend was not for me! With just a little sugar and almond milk and it was something I couldn’t drink. The flavors didn’t go well to me but to each his own. But other than that it was great! I just ordered the Medium box and I look forward to trying new flavors! The only reason why I gave it four stars and not five is because of the flavors I tried.

Unlike all other coffee systems promising fast and simple, this fast and simple preparation delivers excellent flavor.  The big negative for me is the inflexible delivery schedule options.  This is an occasional, not daily, cup for us.  We brew George Howell or use illy espresso pucks in the morning.  Cometeer is for now and then in the afternoon or evening.  Likely decision will be to cancel after a few deliveries and restart when/if it makes sense.  My advice is to make the schedule options broader.  But great coffee!",4

1926,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Medium/Dark Box,10/18/2021,I've really enjoyed the coffee so far.  I'm about two boxes into my original order.  What I really enjoy so far is that the coffee tastes fresh and has no taste of preservatives whatsoever.  It's been a nice change from my typical cold brew at home.  I like to leave them in the fridge over night and make iced coffee with them in the morning.  One pod is perfect for a whole day.,4
1927,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Medium/Dark Box,10/13/2021,"The coffee and making it are really surprisingly good. The cups must have defrosted in shipping and then refrozen in my place, making them not at all easy to pop out as all your promo stuff shows. They stick to the inside of the pods and I have to immerse the pod in boiling water to melt it first. Not crazy about that since there’s ink on the outside of the pod and maybe they are dirty, so I can’t just melt it in the same cup I’m using.",4
1928,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Light Box,10/12/2021,"This was easily the best instant coffee I've tried. Each of the coffees in the box had a pleasant malty sweetness, balanced acidity, and fruity notes that I didn't have to search for. That being said, the flavor isn't quite as pronounced or complex as the fruity, floral, and herbal notes I get from pour overs. Which I expect to be the case - there's going to be some compromise between quality and convenience.

As somebody who regularly buys light-roasted whole beans to brew at home, I don't think I'll drink Cometeer regularly - it's a bit pricier, and I don't mind putting in the extra effort for a tastier cup. But I do see myself buying it occasionally to have on hand for when I run out of beans or don't have the time to brew a pour over.",4
1929,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Light Box,10/12/2021,"When I first saw an ad for Cometeer I admit, I was skeptical. I work at a coffee shop and roaster, and this experience has taught me that freshness is the most important part of the process to make a great cup of coffee. Moreover, method is as influential as quality; the way coffee is brewed really affects the flavor of the finished product. I was curious to know whether or not both the preservation and method of Cometeer’s product could really produce the nuanced flavor that I look for in coffee.

I was pleased to find that the coffee was surprisingly balanced and flavorful; not only this, but the brew method actually creates a new flavor experience. Let me get nerdy here for a minute: I tend to prefer light roasts, which often produce floral or fruity notes with a good deal of acidity. Trying four different coffees, I found that the Cometeer brew (or melt, rather) method actually produced somewhat of a different flavor profile from coffees I have enjoyed many times. These coffees turned out a little less acidic which allowed new flavors to shine. This isn’t necessarily better or worse — just different. For someone who drinks fresh coffee every day, it was exciting to taste something new and unexpected.

So yes, the coffee is great, and the method brings something new to the table. That leads to my one criticism in my experience with Cometeer. I can’t see myself wanting to drink my coffee this way all of the time, as I like to brew coffee in all kinds of ways. Unfortunately, the subscription model that Cometeer operates by makes it difficult to see myself jumping on board, as I probably would be getting way more coffee than I really needed. I understand that this model offers convenience and helps to keep costs reasonable, but I think it would be great if Cometeer would also offer their uniquely produced coffee to be purchased as needed by coffee enthusiasts like me. If so, I would definitely buy more in the future!",4

They are good and easy to make, and I appreciate the full recyclability of all the packaging. I am a little concerned about how far they have to travel to get to me.

1936,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Light Box,09/27/2021,"The coffee arrived very well packaged, with clear instructions on how to handle, store, and brew the coffee. The design is very clean and clear — well done.

The coffee itself is pretty darn surprisingly good. When brewed with hot water, it tastes like a great pour over freshly made at the best coffee shops. There is no bitterness whatsoever in the light roast box, and there is the much desired complexity and depth to the flavor. 

It’s not so affordable, compared to buying whole beans and making everything yourself, BUT if you were going to a coffee shop or have no time whatsoever or get inconsistent coffee, the $2 per cup is much more reasonable (though still high in the long run…)

My biggest issue is that there isn’t control over which beans/roasts you get. They’re preselected based off of the strength of roasting (or decaffeinating), but that’s all. Some of the roasts I got are awesome and others are merely very good. It is super important moving forward that there is more customizability available for making a box. E.g. maybe someone wants four packs of the same coffee, or maybe they want to be completely surprised each month, or maybe they want two of their choice and two selected by Cometeer.

I will be more inclined to pay the full $64 if I know that I can choose what I am getting.

But, to all who are hoping to try, it’s hard to go wrong. I highly recommend *trying* it. It is worth it, and then you can then decide if it’s right for you.",4

1985,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Light Box,06/22/2021,"Convenient and high quality coffee. The only 2 things that I don’t particularly like is that you can’t choose Tasting Notes that you want in your coffee, you can only choose the roast level. The second thing is that $2 per 6-8 oz cup is just a little too much in my opinion. Understanding the process and the amount of money that the company spent on everything, I think $2 will add up over time, especially if you drink coffee a couple of times a day and not just once. For $49, I think it would be a good deal for convenient coffee that would be okay for everyday.",4

1988,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Medium/Dark Box,06/17/2021,I enjoyed this product. It's very convenient to be able to pull a pod from the freezer and pour hot water on it. I enjoy the taste as well. The only thing I don't like is the need to have a subscription because I don't drink enough to make it worth it. Would enjoy the ability to buy a box at a time.,4
1989,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Light Box,06/15/2021,"It's surprisingly good coffee. This is far superior to any other coffee preparation that isn't freshly brewed coffee. It beats pods, pucks, and powders easily. Those are merely brown caffeinated liquid. This... This is coffee.",4

The price point is fine, maybe a little on the high side if it were my only 'go to' coffee choice at the house. We have a nice espresso machine that I typically make Americanos for my day-to-day coffee. At $8 a 1lb bag, the three coffee drinkers in my house go through about a bag a week (about 5 cups a day total). If we were to substitute all our coffee needs with Cometeer I'd need to take out a second mortgage. I do like having Cometeer on hand for quick needs or late night cups of coffee where I don't want to fuss with the espresso machine. Overall, a great product, I wouldn't look to Cometeer to replace my Americanos daily. Hope this helps. Great cup of coffee!",4
1999,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Mixed Box,05/25/2021,The coffee is quite good but my question would be how much better than a quality coffee I purchase regularly? Not sure if it’s worth 2 dollars per cup? I’ll continue to test over the coming weeks before I render a final verdict.,4

These honestly work perfectly for that, but can't say that these would beat making the coffee myself otherwise.

It was a pleasure to try such a variety, but we really weren't a fan of one of the lights with Cola flavors. I'm wondering if there are ways to review individual coffees or opt out of certain ones. (We tried a dark-only box next to avoid getting that or other lights we don't like.)

Also, there is a decent amount of solid sediment in the bottom of each cup and we weren't sure what to do with it (mix it in or leave it?). My friends at lower elevations (we are in Colorado) did not encounter this, they said. My friend in Colorado had the same experience, so maybe it's an elevation thing?

I'd gladly subscribe at $1.50/cup. It's a perfect second cup of coffee. You melt it and have coffee ready to drink in a minute or less, and it's a decent cup of joe. It hits all the marks I need for a second cup. It's decent, fast, smaller, and doesn't take a lot of work.",3

2087,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Mixed Box,01/06/2022,"It was interesting to try Cometeer, and it absolutely tastes better than any dehydrated instant coffee. However between all the insulation, the expedited shipping, dry ice, and individually-packaged pods, it seems too resource-intensive to really be sustainable. Plus who knows how efficient the coffee-making process itself is. 

There is a lack of options, so my starter box contained a dark roast that tasted generic and heavy, and a light roast that was far too acidic for me. I tried both, but I would never have chosen either. The two medium roasts were good, but there should be a way for people to customize their boxes even for the first shipment. 

Finally, the cost ends up being about $2 per cup -- but that's only really 6 oz unless you like very weak coffee. I haven't cancelled yet, but really don't think I will continue my subscription when I can make my own delicious cold brew with great beans I love from local roasters, for less than 20% of the cost of Cometeer. 

Cometeer is very good for ""instant"" coffee, but aside from the convenience for your daily cup(s), I don't think it's worth the cost or use of resources.",2

2089,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Light Box,01/05/2022,Tastes stale to me. Maybe it's the way my taster is wired (i returned my Ember for this reason) but sadly this is not for me.,2
2090,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Medium/Dark Box,01/04/2022,"I liked the technology and concept, but just the flavor of the coffee I got put me off of this product.  Also, it is not easy to select a particular brand/flavor of coffee from the web site, I I just GAVE UP on using this product.  Terrible information on the coffee flavors and helping the customer find a good fit.",2

2093,cometeer.com,Jot,Discovery Guide,11/08/2021,"I found that 8oz of hot water make a cup that tasted watered down for my liking. I’m sure I can make a smaller cup that tastes better, however, I wouldn’t want a cup of coffee in the morning smaller than 8oz. My wife enjoyed it as a cold coffee option. It’s a bit too expensive to buy continuously for the results. I used third wave water heated to 205 degrees F. The brew method was very convenient ",2
2094,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Dark Box,10/20/2021,"I love the concept.  And the ""Dark"" Box has some fantastic coffee in it.  It is excessively expensive though.  I'm not sure everyone would be able to afford the expense, but if they can, it's worth it!",2

2097,cometeer.com,Jot,Pilot Program - Medium/Dark Box,01/04/2022,"Evidently I don't like specialty coffee.  The idea is fantastic and is why I spent so much to get a sampler pack to try.  Unfortunately, no matter how much or how little hot water I add to the coffee, it's too acidic and/or bitter depending on the type of coffee.  I don't think it's the way the coffee is brewed and concentrated, but feel like it's just that I don't like specialty coffee.  I took an immersion brewing class at a local coffee roaster and didn't like the results, which everyone else in the class was really enjoying.  I would imagine that if you like specialty coffee you would really like this concept and the coffees offered.  I prefer a smooth, balanced cup of coffee and none of what I sampled met my expectations.  Still glad I tried it though.",1
