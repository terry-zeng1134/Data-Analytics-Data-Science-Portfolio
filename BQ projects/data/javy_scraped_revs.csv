I got the caramel. I was hoping it would be good for the price,  but kind of hoping it wasn‚Äôt super good at the same time so I wouldn‚Äôt be disappointed when I couldn‚Äôt afford to buy more bottles.  It‚Äôs so freaking good! Not bitter at all, which is why I like it so much! I‚Äôve tried it iced a few times with frothed half and half and made fancy drinks with it, and then I tried it hot. Iced is way better in my opinion! ",4

Javy's customer support has been nothing short of AMAZING. From sorting out shipping delays to immediately righting a wrong and sending out the missing bottles within a few hours of being notified, I cannot stress enough how much I appreciate this company.

The coffee is great and very convenient. I'm still trying to find the sweet spot for my personal taste, but it's a flavorful cup of coffee that lends itself well to both hot and cold beverages. I have 10 bottles (8 with 2 on the way) but I'll be ordering more when they run out!",5

180,javycoffee.com,Javy,Microdose - Liquid Coffee Concentrate,2021-04-07T19:56:23.917Z,I have really gotten to like Javy over other coffee products. I like that I can decide when to have it and which way I want to drink it. I like it both hot and iced. You can control the strength of the coffee. That might be why I use it too fast. That is a personal thing though. The only issue I have with Javy is keeping it in stock at home. I have learned through trial and error to order a larger supply than I know I need and to order sooner than I think I should. Javy worked through my dis-satisfaction at the speed at which they shipped my orders. They explained their process so I have a better understanding of why at times it takes a while to get it made and shipped. Patience really is a virtue. I have learned to be that type of person with Javy.,5

195,javycoffee.com,Javy,Microdose - Liquid Coffee Concentrate,2021-03-08T22:31:04.958Z,"I feel compelled to warn you about what you're getting into when you try Javy for the first time.  

I was a 71 yr old, retired nurse living on a fixed income and enjoying my morning 1-2 cups of instant coffee with creamer and sweetener. I figured it didn't really matter how good the coffee tasted as I ""doctored"" it every morning.

I actually ordered my first bottle out of curiosity. I was intrigued by the concept and drawn in by the ""hype"". So I ordered 1 bottle just to see. Well...

I was hooked. I knew after my first cup that I was in LOVE. Even with all my 'doctoring"", I could taste the strong mellow flavor of the coffee. So good!!! 

Had I not ordered the first bottle, I would be living happily, never knowing the joy of wonderful coffee flavor. I still drink it with creamer and sweetener (that will never change) and, sometimes, with almond milk. 

So I caution you. If you are planning on trying just 1 bottle, BEWARE. You, like me, will be hooked and never consider drinking ANY other coffee. Don't say I didn't warn you!",5

199,javycoffee.com,Javy,Javy Coffee,2021-02-28T15:22:41.219Z,I have been using Javy coffee for a few months now and totally love it. I first tried it making cold brew and immediately was hooked on how easy it was to make it and the exceptional flavor. I then tried it hot and was sold on the great taste. I love being able to make a cup or two and not having to make it in the coffee drip machine.  I have also shared your product with several of my co-workers and they have all fallen in love with it. Some even have placed orders.  I work as a 911 Telecommunications Officer on the deep midnight shift. The Deputies and I are always on the lookout for something to keep us awake and not give us the jitters. So they definitely are hooked now. You were so very kind to send some bottles for my colleagues to try and everyone just loves the Javy! I have pictures I will send. This has been the best pick me up beverage I have found and cannot say enough how Javy has changed the future of coffee. You have done a job well done.,5
200,javycoffee.com,Javy,Microdose - Liquid Coffee Concentrate,2021-02-24T22:18:58.791Z,I loved that I know longer have to drink coffee grounds in my cold brew! I made a pitcher of cold brew in a pitcher specifically made for cold brew and it still leaked grounds into the brew. I then tried Javy and it was weak so I was able to just add more Javy to my liking. It's actually a cost savings to me because I don't have to throw the pitcher away cause it is too weak or has grounds in it. I love the ease and convenience of Javy.,5

I liked the idea of this concentrate, so I thought I would give it a shot. This is by far, hands down, the best coffee I have tasted. I actually enjoy this black. It is smooth and does not have that bitter aftertaste. When I use creamer, I don‚Äôt feel the need to add any sugar or sweetener. I really don‚Äôt see myself buying the pods anymore.

Javy isn't cheap, pricewise, but still I have save a considerable amount by making my own with Javy compared to the outrageously priced Starbucks equivalent. You get what you pay for in this life, right? I have already re-ordered once, and suffice it to say I see myself being a regular customer for the foreseeable future. And full disclosure: I also tried a competitor, and there is no comparison. Javy wins hand down. Mark me down as a happy customer!

I then realized I wasn't adding enough of the javy. It's one or two teaspoons per 6 oz. I was making a big ol travel tumbler full and could barely taste the coffee. Now when I make my morning iced coffee I add two TABLESPOONS. I know that seems like to much but I'm mixing up like 25 maybe 30 oz. I'm not sure exactly cause it's not a marked tumbler but it's pretty big anyway now with that much, it's remarkable and I love it. It doesn't last nearly as long using that much but it taste sooo good. I'm addicted already. I'm ordering more today. It's really worth it. Saves time, way less messy and tastes like coffee house brew. There is a learning curve. Just pay attention to how many oz your making and adjust accordingly and you will be in love with the rich deep flavor of this truly awesome product. ",5

The last shipment I received contained my regular order of 2 bottles. But they used new bottle caps and, despite their usual very careful packaging, one of the bottle caps broke and the contents spilled throughout the shipping box. Most of it stayed inside the bottle, but enough spilled to make a real mess.

I sent Javy a note about it with pictures of the broken cap and box interior. I didn't ask for a replacement, but just wanted to let them know about the failure of one of their new caps. Within just a few days I received a box from them with not one replacement bottle, but two. It was completely unnecessary as far as I was concerned (the second bottle for sure!), but a nice example of a company that wants to make sure their customers are happy by going above and beyond to solve a problem. I really appreciate that.",5

I love coffee, and buy all kinds and brands, ground and often, whole bean, but I'm at a point where the taste is fine - and like with beer(back when I was drinking) - I can tell a difference in coffees.

It's good and makes a quick cup of coffee take way less time than brewing or going out for something. The only thing I'd point out is that the 1 tablespoon serving size was a bit weak for me.

I thought having a boggle that's portable would help me save time and money, and I was right. The stuff is pretty good! That said, I don't think it's strong enough--two tsps in the Javy mug with ice, a little water and coconut milk, and stevia drops and I can't really taste the coffee, so I end up using more and I've gone through more already than I had expected to.

Now I‚Äôve got just over half a pitcher of iced coffee yumminess that I pour into 12-14oz mason jar. Enough for 2 ppl to have a refill or 3-4 ppl to have just one. It really is like coffee crack lol.

I mix it with some cold filtered water and a splash of cream and I am good to go  I can also make  large cup to take to work and skip the drive through at the expensive coffee places. Was skeptical at first but I really love the taste. I can make it strong like an expresso if I want and it doesn't taste bitter or weaker for a late afternoon treat (with a little flavored creamer. ) Thanks for making a great product  I will be telling my friends about this,5
2351,javycoffee.com,Javy,Javy Coffee,2021-04-21T19:54:56.913Z,"This coffee is not only delicious, convenient, it is smooth, tasty and never bitter. I can make hot and/or cold drinks within seconds.

It runs down the side and you have to wipe it up.  The coffee was smooth and wasn't bitter.  Doesn't totally taste like 'coffee', but good.  I wouldn't recommend this product because of the 'application' of pouring.",4

I love coffee, and almost always it‚Äôs iced coffee. Always with a little milk, and no sweetener. I tried putting a couple teaspoons of Javy into a glass with ice, then filled it with about 6 ounces of milk. INSANELY GOOD. 

Decided to try it black the next day, which I would never do with regular coffee. (Simply replaced the milk with ice water). Wow‚Äîthat was just as good!  No bitterness, no chemicals, nothing. 

Just a damn good cup of coffee.",5

Only thing keeping a star off of this (and I'd only dock half a star if I could) is that if you're trying to follow the directions and use 1 tsp, the precious java drips down the side of the jar, sometimes more than what gets in the spoon/cup! If you pour fast, this is less of an issue, but then measuring that much becomes less of a science and more of an eyeball thing.
Bought 3 initially, and have since bought 8 more!",4

We were buying Stoke, which we LOVE, but the bottles in my recycling were bothering me. I have changed a huge amount of purchases to reduce plastic recyling i.e. cleaning products, etc.  We were so happy that we also love Javy! The price is comparable to Stoke (when given a ""sale"" offer.  I wouldn't purchase at the regular price. THAT would be too expensive.) and the small glass bottles make my heart feel better. As long as the % off price remains I will continue to purchase Javy.  Two teaspoons is the serving size we use.  The taste is so delicious and very smooth.  We're very happy with Javy!",5

I also prefer iced coffee, so brewed coffee gets watered down and only lukewarm over ice. I was then buying pre-packaged iced coffee from the grocery store. But they are expensive and only last 2 or three days. Enter Javy. It's quick, it tastes good and I can make it so many different ways. My favorite idea is ice, a prepackaged protein shake (Premier Protein, GNC Total Lean, Muscle Milk, etc.) a good spoonful of Javy and a little bit of water. Breakfast and morning coffee in one! The protein shake acts as creamer and it becomes a flavored iced latte that is filling. Great low-cal, healthy way to start the day. It also goes great with the many flavors of Skinny Syrups I have for that total coffee shop experience at a fraction of the price and calories.",5

I've never been much of a fan of hot drinks, be it coffee, tea, etc.  This product is fantastic for iced coffee.  I can keep all of the ingredients really cold so when the ice comes into the picture, it doesn't melt much and water down the drink.  Most instant coffee won't dissolve in cold water.  Furthermore, this tastes better than instant powdered coffee, and it is just so much quicker and easier for single serving coffee, period.  My Keurig is nice and all, but there's so much plastic waste, and I still have to chill the coffee, which means I get a watered down drink.",5

It‚Äôs very convenient to carry it around and have coffee on the go. It doesn‚Äôt take much like you said to have a cup. Only thing and I mean only thing that bugged me was the top of the javy bottle and how it pored out and dripped on the side of the bottle and was sad to see it wasted. If only javy could make a no drip bottle top so when pouring out of the bottle it will not be wasted.,5

2898,javycoffee.com,Javy,Javy Coffee,2021-01-12T23:54:22.901Z,I was skeptical until I tried it.   It is so convenient and amazingly good.  So much easier than even keurig.  I make my cold coffee the night ahead so all I have to do is grab and go in the morning.,5

The downside is I have to use more milk, and less ice or it gets a little clumpy when I blend it.  The hot espresso slightly melts the ice and makes it a smoother drink.",5

I have been drinking some of the best coffees money can buy. As a GM in restaurants that range from fast foods to 4**** Europe‚Äôs finest. To say my coffees palate has been spoiled is putting it mildly.
Your particular brand is everything from the creamy smooth texture to the full bodied flavor of really good coffees without bitter after taste.

Bravo and hands down the best coffee I‚Äôve ever had!

2997,javycoffee.com,Javy,Microdose - Liquid Coffee Concentrate,2020-12-13T22:30:00.000Z,I wasn‚Äôt a real coffee drinker. I may have a cup once a month or so. I saw this product online and decided to give it a try as I usually go to Starbucks daily for a large Ice Tea for my morning start beverage. I tried one of SB‚Äôs cold brew ice coffees and really enjoyed it. I was spending anywhere from $3.60-$5.00 every morning. Have Javy a try and will never go back. Make my own ice coffees and hit the road ever day. Best thing is the taste and value!!!!!,5
2998,javycoffee.com,Javy,Microdose - Liquid Coffee Concentrate,2020-12-13T14:27:00.000Z,"I love this stuff. Would like other flavors, not vanilla or hazelnut. A different lid that reduces spilling would be nice if possible.",5

3003,javycoffee.com,Javy,Microdose - Liquid Coffee Concentrate,2020-12-11T16:06:00.000Z,"Only 1 cup in so far. 

Pros: Tastes good, easy to make, stores well. Not feeling a caffeine hit, but I made the first cup a little light. Aiming for a more espresso strength on cup 2.

Cons: Flavor and smell out of the bottle is very reminiscent of Sanka, which I assume is to be expected as a concentrated coffee. I was just hoping for a more fresh roasted scent. And the bottle pours a little sloppy. Measuring out my tsp for my coffee, I lost a tsp with dribbling down the side of the bottle onto my counter.",4
3004,javycoffee.com,Javy,Microdose - Liquid Coffee Concentrate,2020-12-11T02:47:00.000Z,Javy has a good coffee flavor but I drink coffee for both flavor and an energy boost.

There is zero bitter taste and you can take it anywhere and adjust the strength as you feel like it just by adding a little more concentrate. No more time and money wasted on making my own or buying it out. This is a no brainer for me.,5

My mornings are usually spent doing my essential workout, getting my schedule ready for the day, and packing in a healthy breakfast. Couple this with my necessary dose of Coffee to wake up my mind, and I almost always struggle to be on time to the office and always end up spilling coffee on my clothes and all the stuff I carry around. Javy has solved all this hassle and the daily grind. Long gone are the days filled with the struggle! Now I just need to heat up water while I exercise, and then put in 2 teaspoons of Javy and my daily cup of Coffee is ready. Just like that! Javy is saving me a lot of money that I would normally spend on a street-side Coffee shop. It lasts longer than my monthly pack of coffee grounds, costs less, is much easier to use, and packs a strong punch! What‚Äôs best is that I can conveniently put it in my backpack and use it in public whenever I feel the sudden urge to drink Coffee!",5

Before, I used to rush around the house trying to get ready for work, packing up important stuff, while putting in my best effort to get a cup of coffee in. Most of the times, I had to settle for a cup of Starbucks until I realized I couldn‚Äôt take it in anymore. With Javy, I don‚Äôt need to struggle anymore. Just 2 teaspoons of Javy and it makes the best Cappuccino! I can do all this in under 5 minutes and that leaves a TON of time for other important to-dos, not to mention it is LITERALLY saving me hundreds of dollars that I usually spend on expensive coffee grounds or ready-made Starbucks. Javy is an easy to make, low-cost and extremely delicious concentrate that I wished I'd found earlier!",5
