camysmom,27-Dec-20,"This sparkling is made of agave, white tea, white cranberry and ginger extract. It has a unique pleasant taste with a slight hint of sweetness, unlike most sparkling grape juice. It's bubbly just like champagne so it's great for toasting in a champagne flute or wine glass without the alcohol. It is very bubbly and will bubble over but IMO it sets the mood to a festive occasion! Awesome for baby showers and gift giving to those who don't consume alcohol. The only downside is that it's costly.","TÖST All-Natural Non-Alcoholic Sparkling Beverage with White tea, White cranberry, Ginger, 25.4 Fl Oz (Pack of 6)",5
Beaker,13-Jun-21,Very good. Great for people who can't have alcohol or just don't want to. I bought it for a Mom-to-be for her baby shower and a friend with kidney disease that cannot drink alcohol. Big hits and great flavor. I will buy it again.,"TÖST All-Natural Non-Alcoholic Sparkling Beverage with White tea, White cranberry, Ginger, 25.4 Fl Oz (Pack of 6)",5
David C. Jones,9-Jul-21,"I was introduced to this drink when it was given to me as a gift. I enjoyed it but couldn't find it locally, even though it is apparently a Vermont product (and I live in VT). I ordered it on Amazon. Unfortunately, although I ordered a dozen bottles, only 9 came in the shipping box and 1 of those bottles was broken in shipping. The vendor immediately shipped me 4 bottles to replace the broken one and the 3 missing bottles. Great product and great customer service! I can't wait to see if they come up with more flavors than this one and the Rose. Both are delicious.","TÖST All-Natural Non-Alcoholic Sparkling Beverage with White tea, White cranberry, Ginger, 25.4 Fl Oz (Pack of 6)",5
Julie Parrish,30-Jan-22,1 of the 3 bottles was broken. Can't find a way to get a replacement. No contact seller link and can't go through replacement links with Amazon stating it's not eligible. Sad since we love the product and paid quite a bit for the bottles. I would order again but not now due to lack of customer service and out money for a product we didn't get to use.,"TÖST All-Natural Non-Alcoholic Sparkling Beverage with White tea, White cranberry, Ginger, 25.4 Fl Oz (Pack of 6)",1

Joni LaFerriere,3-Aug-21,"I can no longer drink alcohol and this product is a great substitute! It looks like a sparkling rose in a sophisticated bottle, but contains zero alcohol and NO chemicals. It can be too sweet if I drink too much of it, but is low sugar at only 9 grams. Add a little seltzer to it in a pretty glass and it feels like happy hour without the awful side effects.","TÖST Rosé All-Natural Non-Alcoholic Sparkling Beverage Refresher with White tea, Elderberry, Ginger, 25.4 Fl Oz (Rosé, Pack of 3)",5
